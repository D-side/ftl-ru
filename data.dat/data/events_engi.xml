<event name="START_BEACON_ENGI">
	<text load="START_BEACON_ENGI"/>
</event>
<textList name="START_BEACON_ENGI">
	<text>You have arrived in Engi space. The Mantis have been threatening the Engi core worlds, but you should be able to stock up for your journey.</text>
	<text>You have arrived in Engi space. The fall of the Federation has brought tough times for these robotic lifeforms, but they're usually willing to help.</text>
</textList>

<event name="STORE_ENGI">
	<text load="STORE_ENGI"/>
	<store/>
</event>
<textList name="STORE_ENGI">
	<text>The Engi can do remarkable things with just a pile of scrap. The Engi hive at this beacon are selling equipment for just that.</text>
	<text>A message arrives: "Your scrap, ours. Our weapons for you." You're about to raise the shields when you realize it's just an Engi trader looking for a trade.</text>
	<text>An Engi ship hails: "Engine upgrade necessary for travel home. Sale of equipment necessary for engine upgrade."</text>
</textList>

<event name="NOTHING_ENGI">
	<text load="NOTHING_ENGI"/>
</event>
<textList name="NOTHING_ENGI">
	<text>The complex arrangements of ship hulls and FTL drive capacitors floating abandoned in space suggest the Engi were here not too long ago; but no longer.</text>
	<text>You arrive at a green planet with great plains and rolling waterfalls. It would be of little interest to the Engi nearby.</text>  <!-- JUSTIN TO DO-  MAKE GREEN PLANET-->
	<text>You have arrived near an Engi construction yard. Most Engi maintain their bi-pedal appearance out of habit but here you see a number of Engi hives working together to create massive organic machines adept at building ships. Truly a sight to behold.</text>
	<text>Even though each "individual" Engi is made up of trillions of nano-machines, their culture still revolves around traditional social interactions. A nearby station seems to be constructed for entertainment of passing Engi travellers.</text>
	<text>You see a number of Engi space stations and fleets nearby. Despite looking like piles of junk loosely tied together they are actually a model of efficiency. They just lack a certain aesthetic emphasis in their constructions.</text>
	<text>This system appears quite peaceful. You're not sure how long it'll last between the combined threats of the Rebels and Mantis.</text>
	<text>There are a number of merchant ships passing through the area despite the threat of Mantis invasion. No doubt interested in buying the efficient technology of the Engi.</text>
	<text>You see a small Rebel carrier in the distance. You lay low and try to blend in with the other traffic. However it's surprising to see a Rebel military ship alone deep in Engi space.</text>
	<text>The Engi seem to have avoided this particular node, along with every other life-form. You keep your eyes peeled for reasons why, but spin up the FTL without event.</text>
	<text>A cluster of Engi satellites in orbit of a nearby planet are the only clue the mechanical species was ever here. You have other places to be.</text>

<textList name="ENGI_GIFT">
	<text>An Engi vessel hails you. "Identity: Federation? Outlier probability. Implies... revival. Implies... hope. Assistance suggested." They offer some supplies.</text>
	<text>You cross paths with an Engi cargo vessel hurrying home before the Mantis fleets attempt to take over this sector. They're happy to offload some of their cargo to get home faster.</text>
	<text>You make contact with an isolated Engi science station who are staying put despite the likelihood of Mantis invasion. They suggest you trial some experimental technology.</text>
	<text>This was the site of a recent battle. Either a show of Mantis force, or the Engi here weren't disposed to go peacefully. You pick through the pieces.</text>
</textList>

<event name="ENGI_FLEET_DELAY" unique="true">
	<text>You notice an Engi colony hiding on the other side of a nearby moon. It turns out they're excavating an equipment cache from the Federation-Mantis War, and they suggest it might be used to lure the pursuing rebel fleet.</text>
