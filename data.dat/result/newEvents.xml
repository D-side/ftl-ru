       TEXT LISTS				  
	  ***********		
-->

<textList name="TIPS_LIST">
	<text>TIP: Death -  Remember, losing is part of the fun! ... No, I'm serious...</text>
	<text>СОВЕТ: Зачистка секторов — От каждого сектора стоит брать всё возможное для развития корабля, так как каждый следующий сектор сложнее предыдущего.</text>
	<text>TIP: Exits -  It's tempting to rush for the Sector exits, but exploring is the only way to upgrade your ship. Try and get as much out of each Sector as possible.</text>
	<text>TIP: Targets -  Prioritize your targeting in combat. Weapons and Shields are usually the best choice, but if they're fleeing, hit their Engines or Piloting to prevent escape.</text>
	<text>СОВЕТ: Скрытый выбор — Когда в событии вы видите ответ подсвеченный синим, то это специальная опция которая стала доступна благодаря вашему оснащению.</text>
	<text>СОВЕТ: Система повреждений — Если из-за пожара или вторжения система выходит из строя полностью, то корпус также получает единицу повреждения.</text>
	<text>TIP: Power Bars -  Upgraded Systems can be helpful even if you don't have enough reactor power to use them; they still absorb one damage.</text>
	<text>СОВЕТ: Орудия — Вы можете поставить в очередь выстрел до того, как орудие будет заряжено. Оно выстрелит, когда будет заряжено.</text>
	<text>TIP: Cloaking -  Cloaking prevents enemies from firing on your ship or charging their weapons. It also increases your base evasion by 60.</text>
	<text>СОВЕТ: Абордаж — Если вас берут на абордаж, сражайтесь рядом с медицинским отсеком. Если ничего не помогает, разгерметизируйте отсеки корабля.</text>
	<text>TIP: Oxygen -  If the ship's room color changes from tan to red, it means you're losing oxygen. Crew will be damaged and fires will burn out in rooms with red hazard stripes.</text>
	<text>TIP: Shield Piercing -  Missiles ignore shields. Use missiles to damage a powerful ship's Shields System. Just remember that Defense Drones can shoot down missiles!</text>
	<text>СОВЕТ: Выбор — Результаты большинства выборов будут иметь разные последствия. Вы никогда не можете быть уверены в том, что может произойти.</text>
	<text>СОВЕТ: Автоматическое ведение огня позволит вам беспрерывно вести огонь по единожды указанной вами цели. Но обращайте внимание и на то, из чего вы ведете огонь. Если из ракет, то следите за их количеством.</text>
	<text>TIP: Evasion -  Evading enemy shots is crucial, but it requires functioning engines AND a pilot. Having someone man the engines will increase your evasion as well.</text>
	<text>СОВЕТ: Сенсоры — Если корабль станет тёмным, не паникуйте. Просто отремонтируйте подсистему сенсоров.</text>
	<text>СОВЕТ: Дроны — Если вы боретесь против вражеских дронов, то цельтесь в систему дронов, для того что бы временно отключить их.</text>
	<text>TIP: Beams -  Beam weapons do damage based on the number of rooms they hit. Each Shield bubble will block 1 damage of a beam; it's best to use beams when the enemy's shields are down.</text>
	<text>TIP: Fire -  If fire is spreading, consider opening airlocks and doors to vent the oxygen from parts of your ship. Fire is quickly extinguished without O2.</text>
	<text>TIP: Health -  Pay attention to your crew's health! Use the Medbay to keep them patched up.</text>
	<text>TIP: Upgrades -  Don't forget to upgrade your ship! Often shields are the highest priority, but don't underestimate the usefulness of subsystems.</text>
	<text>TIP: Fuel -  Every jump consumes one unit of fuel, so keep an eye on your reserves. Buy fuel at stores to avoid being left stranded.</text>
	<text>СОВЕТ: Звук — Отрегулировать громкость звуков и музыки можно в меню настроек.</text>
	<text>TIP: Asteroids -  Fighting in asteroid fields is dangerous, but use it to your advantage. Take out enemy Shields and let the rocks take care of the rest.</text>
	<text>СОВЕТ: Туманности — Попадание в туманность временно замедлит продвижение флота повстанцев, но в них есть и свои собственные уникальные опасности.</text>
	<text>TIP: Solar Flares -  Solar flares will cause hull damage in addition to starting fires. Make sure your shields are up to help mitigate this effect.</text>
	<text>TIP: Score -  Your score is based on how many ships you defeat, the number of beacons explored, and your total scrap collection.</text>
	<text>TIP: Augmentations -  Your ship can only hold 3 augmentations. They provide unique benefits to a system, the crew or the entire ship.</text>
	<text>СОВЕТ: Пробоины — Если отсек с пробоиной не имеет кислорода, попробуйте открыть все окружающие двери, это сделает его менее опасным.</text>
	<text>TIP: Rebel Fleet -  The Rebel fleet (represented by the red circle on the map) moves closer to your position every time you jump. Certain events can slow or speed up their movement.</text>
	<text>TIP: Ion Weapons -  Ion weapons de-power and lock a System for a time. If they hit the enemy shields they deal their stun damage directly to the Shields System.</text>
	<text>TIP: Bomb Weapons -  Bombs teleport directly onto either ship. They bypass Shields AND Defense Drones. However, they affect only crew and Systems; they do no damage to the ship's hull.</text>
	<text>TIP: Door Subsystem -  Upgrading your doors will greatly reduce the chance of fire spreading between rooms and will significantly slow boarder movement.</text>
</textList>

<textList name="TIPS_LIST_PC">
	<text load="TIPS_LIST"/>
	<text>СОВЕТ: Пауза — Для постановки игры на паузу, нажмите пробел. Во время паузы вы можете отдавать приказы и управлять системами корабля.</text>
	<text>TIP: Selling -  Weapons, Drones and Augments can be sold for 1/2 the purchasing price at stores. Click on the SELL tab at the top.</text>
	<text>TIP: Hotkeys -  You can charge or arm weapons using number hotkeys: The Weapon Slots are 1-4 on your keyboard, and the Drones are 5-7 (customizeable in the options).</text>
	<text>TIP: Font Size -  Pressing +/- (customizable in options) will let you change the event text size.</text>
	<text>TIP: Weapon Order -  Rearrange a Weapon or Drone schematic by dragging it into the desired position. The left-most slot will be the last to power down if the system is damaged.</text>
</textList>

<textList name="TIPS_LIST_IPAD">
	<text load="TIPS_LIST"/>
	<text>TIP: Pausing -  Tap the PAUSE button at any time to pause the game. You can still issue orders to crew or manipulate system power while paused.</text>
	<text>TIP: Selling -  Weapons, Drones and Augments can be sold for 1/2 the purchasing price at stores. Tap the SELL tab at the top.</text>
	<text>TIP: Weapon Order -  Rearrange a Weapon or Drone schematic by dragging it into the desired position. The bottom-most slot will be the last to power down if the system is damaged.</text>

<!--*******Cloaking-->
<event name="STEALTH_1">
	<text>This is a prototype ship which utilizes advanced Cloaking technology. The trade-off is lack of shields or weaponry. Take advantage of the cloaking device's ability to make enemy shots miss.</text>
</event>
<!--**********Armor/speed-->
<event name="STEALTH_2">
	<text>Этот корабль основан на конструкции, которая существовала до технологии экранирования и была стандартом для всех кораблей. Бронированный корпус и повышенная мобильность являются основным его достоинством.</text>
</event>
<!--*********Shielded-->
<event name="STEALTH_3">
	<text>Этот корабль Федерации предназначен для тестирования новой передовой технологии перезарядки щитов. К сожалению, Вас заставили тестировать его в одиночку.</text>
</event>
<!--*********Boarding-->
<event name="STEALTH_4">
	<text>Этот корабль был предназначен для переброски войск в тыл врага. Как таковой, он не оснащён орудиями по умолчанию, но зато его экипаж — лучшие из лучших.</text>
</event>
<!--**********Drones - space-->
<event name="STEALTH_5">
	<text>Этот корабль представляет собой модифицированное горнодобывающее судно, которое содержит продвинутый ИИ для управления дронами. Он не совсем готов к битве, но будем надеяться, что дроны покроют его недостатки.</text>
</event>
<!--**********Drones - crew-->
<event name="STEALTH_6">
	<text>Ваше новое судно оснащено современными роботами и лучевым оружием. Трудно было найти полный экипаж, так как с роботами довольно страшно работать.</text>
</event>
<!--*********Missile fun time-->
<event name="STEALTH_7">
	<text>The engineer who designed this ship clearly loved missiles. Few opponents will be able to withstand this ship's missile barrage, but be sure to watch your ammo reserves.</text>
</event>
<event name="DEMO_END">
	<text>Поздравляем с окончанием обучения! В качестве последнего урока, вы испытаете, каково это быть уничтоженным более сильным противником. Этот пиратский корабль оснащен самыми передовыми вооружением и системами, в том числе прототипом устройства маскировки. Он собирался пришельцами, известными как лучшие инженеры галактики. А ещё мы отключили ваши двигатели, так что нет смысла пытаться убежать.</text>
