Taking advantage of the last of your fuel reserves, you were able to navigate to a safe distance from the pulsar.

Oh no! A pulsar!

Oh no! This planet is friendly to the Rebels and is shooting at us!

Using your impulse engines, you were able to pull to a safe distance from the hostile planet.

Your pilot deftly avoids the artillery fire from the surrounding fleet while you try to sort out exactly what your plan is....

whatever

Yay

You come across a large trade station. However, as soon as you approach a warning goes out to all ships in the region: "Do not associate with the Federation sympathizer. All who oppose the Rebels will be punished."

Search among the stores to see if someone will sell to you.

Leave.

You decide it's better to not push your luck and move on.

(Mind Control) Alter the announcer's opinions.

You locate the source of the announcement and 'convince' the speaker to rescind his previous statement. Hopefully you will have enough time to shop before he can figure out what just happened.

(Improved Mind Control) Alter the announcer's opinions.

You locate the source of the announcement and 'convince' the speaker to rescind his previous statement. In addition he apologizes by offering complimentary supplies. Hopefully you will have enough time to shop before he can figure out what just happened.

(Advanced Mind Control) Alter the announcer's opinions.

You find a single store that responds to your hails: "Don't open any wide band channels. We'll sell to you but we don't want to draw attention to ourselves."

Your search for a friendly marketplace yields no results but after a time a small shuttle approaches. They release some supplies in your direction with the message, "We are not all friends of the Rebel fleet. Stay strong."

You apparently spoke to the wrong person in your search for a store. Warnings go off and you detect an automated Rebel ship moving in to attack.

A Rebel captain appears on the screen. "I thought we had been doomed to backwater assignments. This is my chance to get back in Command's good graces! Charge the weapons!"

A small rebel research station overlooks a pulsating star. Before you can react a Rebel ship spots you and moves in to attack.

You arrive at an infrequently used beacon close to a pulsar. Before long a Rebel ship happens to jump nearby. Looks like you'll have to fight.

Sensors go wild as a nearby pulsar is detected. While you are attempting to recalibrate the FTL drive, a pirate sneaks up on your ship, weapons charging. Prepare for a fight!

You arrive to find a pulsar dominating the view screen. You see a small silhouette pass in front of the star. Before you can ponder what it is, warning signals go off. It appears to be a ship in a firing trajectory!

A small research station orbits a nearby pulsar. It appears largely abandoned, but you detect power signatures flaring up as soon as you're in scanning distance. A small combat ship launches from the station. Pirates!

Prepare to fight.

(Simple Hacking) Confuse the Anti-Ship Battery's targets.

You spot a weakness in the targeting satellites. Your crew is able to launch a hacking drone to confuse the Anti-Ship Battery's targeting matrix. It should also fire on the Rebel ship now.

(Advanced Hacking) Overwrite the Anti-Ship Battery's target.

You spot a weakness in the targeting satellites. Your crew is able to launch an improved hacking drone to overwrite the Anti-Ship Battery's targeting matrix. It will fire on the Rebel ship instead!

You're shocked to discover a Rebel forward base on this planet. A patrol ship moves in to intercept and sensors indicate an Anti-Ship Battery is about to fire. We've got to get out of here!

You spot a weakness in the targeting satellites. Your crew is able to launch a hacking drone to periodically confuse the ASB's lock signal. It should sometimes fire on the Rebel ship now.

(Advanced Hacking) Override the ASB's target.

You spot a weakness in the targeting satellites. Your crew is able to launch an improved hacking drone to overwrite the ASB's target locks. It will fire on the Rebel ship instead!

As soon as you arrive multiple warnings go off. A hostile automated ship is detected and an Anti-Ship Battery begins firing. This doesn't look good!
