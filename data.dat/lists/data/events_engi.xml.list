You have arrived in Engi space. The Mantis have been threatening the Engi core worlds, but you should be able to stock up for your journey.

You have arrived in Engi space. The fall of the Federation has brought tough times for these robotic lifeforms, but they're usually willing to help.

The Engi can do remarkable things with just a pile of scrap. The Engi hive at this beacon are selling equipment for just that.

A message arrives: "Your scrap, ours. Our weapons for you." You're about to raise the shields when you realize it's just an Engi trader looking for a trade.

An Engi ship hails: "Engine upgrade necessary for travel home. Sale of equipment necessary for engine upgrade."

The complex arrangements of ship hulls and FTL drive capacitors floating abandoned in space suggest the Engi were here not too long ago; but no longer.

You arrive at a green planet with great plains and rolling waterfalls. It would be of little interest to the Engi nearby.

You have arrived near an Engi construction yard. Most Engi maintain their bi-pedal appearance out of habit but here you see a number of Engi hives working together to create massive organic machines adept at building ships. Truly a sight to behold.

Even though each "individual" Engi is made up of trillions of nano-machines, their culture still revolves around traditional social interactions. A nearby station seems to be constructed for entertainment of passing Engi travellers.

You see a number of Engi space stations and fleets nearby. Despite looking like piles of junk loosely tied together they are actually a model of efficiency. They just lack a certain aesthetic emphasis in their constructions.

This system appears quite peaceful. You're not sure how long it'll last between the combined threats of the Rebels and Mantis.

There are a number of merchant ships passing through the area despite the threat of Mantis invasion. No doubt interested in buying the efficient technology of the Engi.

You see a small Rebel carrier in the distance. You lay low and try to blend in with the other traffic. However it's surprising to see a Rebel military ship alone deep in Engi space.

The Engi seem to have avoided this particular node, along with every other life-form. You keep your eyes peeled for reasons why, but spin up the FTL without event.

A cluster of Engi satellites in orbit of a nearby planet are the only clue the mechanical species was ever here. You have other places to be.

An Engi vessel hails you. "Identity: Federation? Outlier probability. Implies... revival. Implies... hope. Assistance suggested." They offer some supplies.

You cross paths with an Engi cargo vessel hurrying home before the Mantis fleets attempt to take over this sector. They're happy to offload some of their cargo to get home faster.

You make contact with an isolated Engi science station who are staying put despite the likelihood of Mantis invasion. They suggest you trial some experimental technology.

This was the site of a recent battle. Either a show of Mantis force, or the Engi here weren't disposed to go peacefully. You pick through the pieces.

You notice an Engi colony hiding on the other side of a nearby moon. It turns out they're excavating an equipment cache from the Federation-Mantis War, and they suggest it might be used to lure the pursuing rebel fleet.

Booby trap the cache.

You transfer down some missile warheads and the Engi rig them to blow before setting a distress signal to attract the fleet's attention.

Secure the cache.

You have the Engi complete their excavations and bring the supplies on-board.

As you jump in you're hailed urgently by an Engi science vessel in the distance. "We propose that you do not see the creature." There's nothing on the scanner, which is when you realize you can't see the creature because you're inside it!

Jump away ASAP.

(Improved Sensors) Scan the monstrosity.

You detect a faint, arrhythmic sub-wave pattern. Could the creature be communicating? You forward your observations to the Engi vessel and they thank you in turn.

(Long-Ranged Scanners) Scan the monstrosity.

An Engi ship in the vicinity, seeing you jump in armed to the teeth, immediately broadcasts its surrender: "Subject goal: wealth. Engi motivation: survival. Transfer of goods acceptable?"

Explain that you're friendly.

Accept their offer of surrender.

The Engi obediently transfer over the goods and get on their way. Money for nothing.

The Engi seem relieved, and eager to get underway. They set off without saying goodbye.

The Engi are satisfied with your explanation. "Beneficial. Subject goal: long, long journey. Remains compatible with transfer of goods from Engi." They send over the gear willingly, and you feel better for it.

A mixed radar signal turns out to be a Mantis attack ship scavenging the remains of an Engi carrier. They turn and fight.

You come across a Mantis raider taking pot shots at a defenceless Engi supply station. Discovering its weapons aren't much of a match for the station's armour, it turns on your ship. Battle stations!

The area looks clear, and you prepare to jump off, but a Mantis scout jumps in behind you! They're as surprised as you are, but their weapons are already online.

You find a Mantis ship harrying a small squad of Engi. They make it to the node and jump off, leaving you toe to toe with their pursuer!

The rebel fighter here would seem to suggest elements of the rebel fleet are already making incursions on Engi space. You move to engage.

There must have been rich pickings for pirates around here up until war broke out. The pirate you encounter here looks worn down, but hungry. You'll have to fight!

You receive a distress call from a nearby Engi ship. "Assistance requested. Danger present. Imminent destruction."

Respond to the call and move in to assist.

Keep your distance.

You receive another message from the ship, this time with a Mantis at the comm-log. "Foolish meatsacks," he yells. Sensors indicate the ship is moving in to attack and boarders teleport from the station.

You approach to find a Mantis ship assaulting a small Engi space station. You prepare for a fight!

The Engi station is stripped bare and there are signs of a fierce battle. The Mantis must have left the distress call active to lure other ships into a trap.

The station was in the process of being evacuated. A number of civilian Engi offer their gratitude as they finalize their preparations to leave. They offer some fuel as a reward.

The station hails you, "Gratitude. Expected probability of defeat without assistance... 86.2 percent. Request suitable reward."

Request fuel.

"Request granted. Fuel transferring."

Request weapon.

"Request granted. Weapon transferring."

Request drone.

"Request granted. Drone schematic transferring."

(Engi Crew) Threat unresolved. Current mission imperative: Protocol 52.34.

They respond, "Understood. Re-establishment of Federation highest import. Transmitting hidden base coordinates. Repairing hull and attaching ship to ship ordnance."

They thank you for the assistance and when you tell them of your mission, one of the Engi asks if he can assist your crew. You welcome him aboard.

The distress signal originates from a small Engi ship under attack by a rebel fighter - but when the Rebels see Federation markings they turn to attack!

The Engi vessel turns out to be very poorly equipped - barely a runabout, really. They're trying to outrun the Rebels, and need all the help they can get.

Give them 25 scrap.

Give them 40 scrap, 2 missiles and 2 fuel.

Give them nothing.

Engi can't feel fear, so they bear you no ill will when you explain you're unwilling to help. They set off on their journey and you do the same.

The words they use are "Need = fulfilled", but you take it for gratitude. They take the next jump in their long journey home.

The Engi are grateful. They don't have any supplies or weapons to spare, but they do send over a self-teleporting med-bot disperser they hope they won't need.

The Engi are grateful. They don't have much by way of supplies but they do offer a drone schematic for your use.

They wouldn't get more than a few jumps with that load-out. You provide them with all the munitions and supplies they should need for the journey home. "Generosity magnitude unpredicted. Well-being syntax error [value too high]. Accept this token."

You arrive at a smoldering Engi research station, its distress call unanswered - attacked by pirates or Mantis most likely. There may be someone left alive, or else something of value left on board.

Board the station.

Ignore it.

The place looks in bad state, probably nothing of use there. Time to move on.

(Improved Sensors) Run another scan.

(Long Ranged Scanners) Run another scan.

You send an away team to investigate, but there's nothing save for the acidic stench of burnt Engi parts. This place is dead.

Your away team reports a wounded Engi and a functioning drone schematic. Then someone yells. The station reactor is overloading and they're running out of time!

Save the Engi!

Save the drone schematic.

Save yourselves!

It's a tough order, but your crew's lives are the priority. They drop everything and return to the ship unharmed. You put some distance on the station before it blows.

One of your crew valiantly grabs the Engi and throws it into the airlock right before the reactor blows and the automatic blast doors slam shut. You have no choice but to mourn their sacrifice and move on.

The brave crewmember's clone strides from the Clone Bay, rather full of themself after such a heroic act.

Continue...

The Engi who was saved offers to join your crew.

Your crew return safely to the airlock with the injured Engi and you put some distance on the station before it blows. The Engi, impressed by your crew, volunteers to join you.

 Your away team heads home with the goods, but as they transfer back to the ship a small explosion blows the airlock and one of the crew is sucked out into space!

Fortunately, your crewmember was close enough to the ship for the Clone Bay to revive them.

The Engi don't feel things the same way other species do. They'd want the tech to be saved. Your crew return safely to the airlock with the drone control and you put some distance on the station before it blows.

Scans reveal the station's reactor is overloading! Not only that, but an injured Engi and a functioning drone schematic are still on board! There's not time for both...

Your away team heads straight for the Engi and returns with time to spare. You put some distance on the station before it blows and the Engi is so impressed by your crew that they volunteer to join you!

Save the Drone Schematic!

The Engi don't feel things the same way other species do. They'd want the tech to be saved. Your away team heads straight for the goods and returns with time to spare. You put some distance on the station before it blows.

You arrive near a small fleet of civilian Engi ships. A simple decryption and translation of their comm frequency tells you that they are having a frantic discussion about something obviously troubling them.

Message them and ask if you can help.

Slightly shocked at your question, their leader quickly responds, "Declined offer with apologetic gratitude. Topic of discussion private matter, no concern of Federation."

Ignore it and move on.

You can't help but wonder what they were discussing as you prepare to jump.

(Engi Crew) Have your Engi crewmember contact them.

Your crewmember syncs with the comm unit to communicate with them directly. You offer your help and a summary of the ship's mission. They respond, "Our goals have analogous elements. However, not all available for disclosure, discretion necessary."

Offer your help.

"Secret technologies stolen by Mantis. Implicit connection to Rebels. Implicit. Tracked Mantis to hidden Rebel base, uploading coordinates."

"However, tracked second ship to different base. Would calculate probability but data insufficient. Cannot risk obvious Rebel-Engi conflict. Also, need time to acquire military ships. Assist in finding technology?"

Agree.

You arrive at one of the Rebel bases that the Engies told you about. It appears abandoned except for one scout ship. Perhaps you could extract information from them.

"Stop! I don't want to die here."

Demand information on the stolen technology.

"Ah, so that's what you're after. Too bad, you followed the wrong ship. The envoy that passed through here was a fake, to trick fools like you. Now let us go!"

Let them go.

Ignore him and attack.

"No, wait..." You cut the transmission and continue the assault.

You arrive at one of the Rebel bases that the Engi told you about. It appears abandoned except for one scout ship. Perhaps you could extract information from them."

"Stop! This isn't worth dying for..."

"Of course, that's why you're here. Yes, they passed by here but I had nothing to do with it, I don't know what they were carrying. I'll transmit coordinates. Now just let us go..."

You prepare an FTL message containing the coordinates to send to the Engi and get ready to jump.

"But we..." You cut the transmission and prepare an FTL message containing the coordinates to send to the Engies. You then focus on the battle.

You have finally caught up with the ships you've been hunting. A hangar-sized cargo ship is being escorted by a number of Mantis ships. As you reconsider the assault, a squadron of Engi ships with pirate emblems jump in and assist you. You prepare to fight the Mantis but scans indicate they are manned by Rebels!

The Engi emerge victorious from their battles with only minor losses. They message you, "Project X-ME56 commissioned by Federation military research division. Advanced stealth cruiser. Project finished during rebellion. Unable to reconnect with Federation military command."

Ask about the Mantis ships.

"Likely ploy by Rebels to avoid breaking non-aggression pact with Engi. 97.56 percent likely. Your mission to assist last Federation fleet, correct? Coordinates?"

Transmit coordinates of Federation command.

"Satisfactory. Delivery of tech will assist in Federation cause. Gratitude alone insufficient. Commencing ship repair and compensation." Their crews deliver an advanced augmentation for installation but you're more pleased to hear that the Federation will have an improved arsenal.

The Engi secret tech has been delivered to the hangar. The stealth ship has been unlocked!

What appeared to be a single damaged ship is in fact two ships that have smashed into each other... there is a flurry of comm signals and damage, and it's hard to determine what occurred. The vessels appear to be... Engi? They look locked together by the impact and can't free themselves.

Attempt to help the ships by prying them apart.

To your surprise, one of the Engi vessels attacks! One ship detaches itself, surprisingly still quite whole, and opens fire - it looks like it's somehow identified you as hostile!

Ignore the damaged vessels.

[Engi Crew] Have your Engi crewmember hail the vessel and assess the damage.

Your Engi crewmember refuses. In a halting use of adjectives and nouns, followed by some animated holographic aids, the Engi explains the ships are... using each other to, loosely translated, "achieve a union." For some reason, this consolidation of ship matter sounds embarrassing and personal.

You elect to leave the two Engi ships... to their "business." After questioning your Engi crewmember, however, you do manage to salvage what scrap parts you can from the perimeter, even though you feel slightly dirty for doing so.

With the ship destroyed, the remaining Engi ship hails you frantically and explains the situation to you.

With the ship disabled, the remaining Engi ship hails you frantically and explains the situation to you.

Apparently, you interrupted the equivalent of a "consolidation" of two ships that were using each other's parts to construct a new vessel. The Engi were not truly hostile, their targeting computers had not finished adjusting. There's nothing to be done about it now. You leave the remains for the surviving ship.

The Engi are awaiting you at the beacon, with their weapons on-line! They explain a computer virus that is wanted for hostile acts against the Engi (multiple counts of binary scrambling, nano-dissolution, and variable interference) is aboard your vessel.

They insist they must destroy your ship to prevent the virus from escaping!

Hold on! Let us try to purge the system code!

Wiping your engine core and shields proves useless... eventually you trap the virus in the weapons systems to purge it, but before you do, the Engi grow restless and attack!

Attack the Engi vessel!

The Engi be damned, no one threatens your ship. You prepare for a fight!

[Hacking System] Isolate and quarantine the virus.

It takes some time, and the virus is slippery, but you eventually confine it to a useless sub-system prison where it frantically begins calculating insults at you. You eject the system from the ship and then silence the little binary criminal with your weapons.

The Engi thank you for deleting the virus, and jump away. They offer a unique ship augmentation as a reward.

[Improved Hacking] Reprogram the virus.

You proceed to interface with the virus and optimize its repair and benevolence routines.

After a few minutes, the virus "sees the light" and integrates itself in a positive manner with the computer society on your ship, repairing your hull and attempting to optimize your reactor.

[Advanced Hacking] Reprogram the virus.

[Lanius Crew] Your Lanius crewmember gestures frantically.

Oddly enough, the Lanius seems aware of which computer the virus is present in, and proceeds to... digest the terminal. There is a burst of O2, and the Engi ship powers down its weapons, no longer sensing the virus on board. The Engi send some parts over to repair your damaged computer, along with a unique ship augmentation as a reward for terminating the virus.

[Engi Crew] Have your Engi crewmember negotiate with the Engi ship.

As the Engi attempts to contact the vessel and negotiate, your Engi crewmember suddenly dissolves into nanites - the virus has murdered again! Detecting activity on board your ship, the Engi vessel opens fire!

The virus appears to have disrupted your clone bay's capability to revive the lost crewmember!

With the ship destroyed, you detect that the virus has abandoned your ship and disappeared somewhere within the systems of the wreckage. It will likely infect whatever Engi ship passes next, but your mission is too vital to risk re-infection by stopping it.

With the Engi crew dead, you detect that the virus has abandoned your ship and disappeared somewhere within the systems of Engi vessel. It will likely infect whatever Engi ship passes next, but your mission is too vital to risk re-infection by stopping it.

With the ship destroyed, you scrap it and prepare to jump away.

With all the Engi dead, you take what you can and prepare to jump away.

To your surprise your Engi crewmember reforms. It looks as if the virus reconstituted, repurposed, and reprogrammed the Engi host and wants to travel with you... and it seems to have learned a great deal from its time on your ship.

Virus
