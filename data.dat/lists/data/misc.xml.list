Added a quest marker to your map!

Upon examining your map, you realize you just won't have time and need to get to the Federation base! You leave the quest for another day.

Added a quest marker to the next sector!

Congratulations, by making it to the 5th sector you've unlocked the Engi playable ship for future playthroughs!

They must have a Super Shield bypass unit; boarders are on board!

 [Warning: You will have to dismiss a crewmember, you are already full.]

Congratulations! You've defeated the Rebel Flagship and ensured the victory of the Federation!

All crewmembers have died. Your ship will continue to drift for eternity. Or until looters destroy it.

One last explosion marks your fate as your ship is torn apart.

The Rebel Flagship has destroyed the Federation Base. All is lost, they've won.

Somehow you've died during the introduction training exercise. Feel free to try again but this doesn't bode well for your mission.

 and 

Thanks to the valiant effort of:

And her successful crew:

The Rebel's flagship was destroyed, throwing their fleet into chaos and ensuring a Federation victory

Requires drone part to deploy

Tip: Use requires spending one drone part to activate, and then constant power (similar to weapons).

Warning: You do not have a Drone System. You can purchase one from a store.

Tip: Currently in cargo. Drag to an available Drone System slot to equip this drone.

Tip: Currently in cargo. Drag to an available Weapon System slot to equip this weapon.

Tip: For every shield bar on the enemy, a beam's damage is reduced by one. For example, a three damage beam against two shield bars will cause one damage in every room it hits.

Tip: Missiles will ignore all enemy shields, but cost one missile to launch. Enemy defense drones will shoot down incoming missiles.

Tip: Bombs teleport past shields and defense drones to land directly on the ship. Like missiles, they cost one missile to launch. They never damage hull, but can be effective at disrupting crew and systems. You can even launch them at boarders on your own ship.

Tip: For every one point of ion damage, one power bar is removed from the target system and it is then locked for 5 seconds, preventing re-powering. If an ion weapon hits shields, the damage is automatically applied to the Shield System.

Autofire On. Weapons by default will continue firing at their target. \n\nTap twice when arming a weapon to toggle its individual mode.

Autofire Off. Weapons will only fire once at their target. \n\nTap twice when arming a weapon to toggle its individual mode.

You deploy your Distraction Buoys, giving you more time to explore this sector before the fleet catches up.

Burn Them Out

Rain of Missiles

Tip: Each laser shot will be blocked by a single shield bubble, regardless of the laser's damage.

Tip: Hull weapons deal double damage if they hit a room that does not have a system or a subsystem.

Tip: Charge weapons can be charged multiple times to generate more firepower.  You can save time and fire the weapon prematurely but it will have fewer shots ready as a result.

Tip: Chain lasers decrease their cooldown every time they fire. Check the green lights on the weapon to see how many times it has fired.

Tip: The Chain Ion increases its damage every time it fires. Check the green lights on the weapon to see how many times it has fired.

Tip: Flak weapons target an area instead of a single room. This loss of accuracy means more firepower and speed than their laser counterparts.

Tip: Crystal weapons pierce a single layer of shields. Only level 2 shields and higher can stop them.

Tip: Combat Drones require 1 drone part to deploy for each new enemy. They will attack the enemy as long as they are powered.

Tip: Defense Drones require 1 drone part to deploy at every new location. They will defend your ship as long as they are powered.

Tip: Boarding Drones require 1 drone part to deploy for each new enemy. They will board the enemy ship and attack as long as they are powered.

Tip: Crew Drones require 1 drone to deploy, but will not need to be deployed again until destroyed. They stay on ship and help your crew as long as they are powered.

Note: Requires powered Medbay to function.

Beam weapons can hit multiple rooms. When aiming one, DRAG your finger to draw its initial path. \n\nOnce drawn, if you continue to drag ONE finger the angle will change, or you can use TWO fingers to change the position. Experiment for an optimal aiming path!

Deployed (Powered): Active and providing its function.

Deployed (Unpowered): Not active, but can be repowered without costing a drone part.

Not Deployed: Will cost one drone part when first powered.
