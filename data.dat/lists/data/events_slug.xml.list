You arrive at the beacon and are relieved at the sight of open space. Nebulas are terribly claustrophobic.

This beacon marks a 'small' gap in the nebula. No colonies or ships in scanning distance.

You are relieved to see your sensors blink back on after the jump. No ships detected.

The Slugs rely heavily on their telepathic powers and are reluctant to give up that advantage by extending beyond nebulas. It's unlikely you'll encounter any this far from the clouds.

You arrive in an area clear of nebula and quickly check to see if the sensors are working. Everything is fine and no ships are detected in the vicinity.

When it comes to Slugs, no news is not necessarily good news. However, if they are watching, they don't seem to want to confront you.

It's not unusual to feel paranoia in a Slug controlled nebula, but for once, it is unfounded.

Either this part of Slug space is deserted, or it's too dense for even Slugs to detect your presence. Time to move.

This area of the nebula seems entirely empty until a small Slug transport and its escorts emerges suddenly from through the clouds, only to disappear again in a matter of seconds.

You explore around the beacon and are shocked when a rock the size of a small moon suddenly looms ahead of you. Scans reveal the solid-looking rock is just a husk, almost entirely mined out of useful minerals.

There are a number of small stations for travellers in the area, lit up by guiding lights and advertisements. Only Slug ships are docked so you decide it's better to avoid a confrontation and steer clear.

A huge Slug teleports from nowhere onto the bridge! Before you can open fire, he's spread his wares across the helm and is brandishing things at you.

You cautiously approach a Slug colony on a huge asteroid. It's a brave person who sets foot on a Slug planet - it can take weeks to get the mucus out of your clothes - but there's business to be done.

It's rare for the Slugs to stay exposed in open space for long periods - the ship here may be lost, or just passing through, but either way he moves in to attack!

You intercept comm chatter from an incoming Mantis ship. "Look. This ship appears not to be owned by the squishy ones. Maybe they won't smell so bad when we cut them open." They move in on your position.

There appears to be a pirate ship nearby. Be on your guard; anyone trying to hunt in Slug territory is either formidable or deeply stupid, and in space, either can be dangerous.

"We knew anyone foolish enough to try and sneak through a Slug nebula would stick to open space. Yield your goods and we may let you live." You cut the transmission in lieu of a response.

Before you can take a moment's rest from the ever present nebulas in this sector, a pirate ship appears behind you and opens fire.

As you arrive at the beacon, a hostile ship immediately registers on your scanners. You didn't expect to see Rebels extending their reach into Slug territory. Charge the weapons!

You jump into empty space and are relieved to see your sensors blink back to life. However, you are less pleased to see them immediately register a rebel ship on an approach vector!

You receive a message from a nearby ship, "Looks like our intelligence was correct! Sneaking through the clouds with the Slugs... No one can hide from the rebellion!"

You are immediately hailed by a dangerous looking ship guarding a station. "I'm feeling generouss today. I shall allow you to choose your own death. Which do you like leasst: shields, oxygen, or weaponsss?"

Shields.

"Very good then!" Your shield power suddenly drops and they charge.

Oxygen.

"A being that would choose sssuffocation? Who am I to judge..." Your life support is sabatoged and they move in to attack.

Weapons.

"Your acceptance of death is almosst admirable... Almosst." Your weapons system registers a hacking module. You hardly have time to respond before they attack.

Offer 35 scrap to leave you alone.

"I really am feeling generousss..." They take the scrap and leave.

(Hacking System) Counter any hack attempt.

"Sssilence won't protect you. I'll make the choice mysself... Wait. Why isn't this working?" You cut transmission and move in to attack.

You arrive to find a small Slug repair station. "Greetingsss traveller! Care for a fix up? We could eassily patch up ssome of that damage."

No thanks.

"Too bad! Trussst iss a rare commodity these days." You prepare to jump.

Sure.

Ask if they would like payment.

You pull up to the automatic station and after a short time they repair 10 hull damage. You begin to offer your thanks but discover that you can't detach from the station.

Demand an explanation.

You dock with the station hoping for a quick turnaround, but the automatic machines take their sweet time. When the process finally finishes, you notice only one damage has been repaired.

As you dock with the station your readings go haywire. An EMP blast resonates throughout the ship and your engines shut down. You're a sitting duck as a ship reveals itself and silently moves in to attack!

"We're glad you have enjoyed our servicessss. Perhaps some fuel would be an appropriate compensssation?"

Give them the 15 fuel they demand.

You transfer the fuel and they release your ship. "Tell your friendsss about us!" Their portable station slips into the clouds.

That's ridiculous!

"I'm ssssorry to hear that." He presses a button and an explosion rocks the ship. They must have planted a bomb while 'repairing'! Prepare for a fight!

"We're glad you have enjoyed our servicessss. Now for payment. To enssssure your cooperation we've taken the liberty of installing a limiter on your weapons system."

Give them the 50 scrap they demand.

You transfer the scrap and they release your ship. "Tell your friendsss about us!" Their portable station slips into the clouds.

Let's get out of here!

You activate your thrusters and force your way away from the station. A ship quickly moves in to engage. You'll need to get out of here fast; there may not be time to get the weapons fully operational!

"Ahhh. A fellow businessman. We offer to fix 10 damage for 50 ssscrap."

Accept.

You perform the transaction and watch carefully as their machines patch the hull. However, everything seems fine. Once they're complete you get ready to jump.

Decline.

"Too bad. Farewell, traveller." Their mobile station slips into the clouds.

Just before the transmission is cut you hear, "They're not falling for it. Just kill the crew and we can ssstrip..." Looks like you're not getting out of here without a fight.

A Slug transport ship is stationed near the beacon with a military escort ship. They message you, "We have been waiting for a customer for agesss. Care to see our waresss?"

"Oh well... We ssshall wait here then." You cautiously put distance between your ships before preparing to jump.

Ask to see the goods.

"Before we get ahead of ourssselves, I need to explain sssome ground ruless of our transsaction. Thesse are dangerous times, yess?"

Continue.

"Firssst... We accept no tradesss, couponss or refundss. Purchasess are final. Underssstand?"

Understood.

"We hold no liability for productsss damaged post ssale. We offer no insurance or customer sservice. Not a problem?"

Not a problem.

Forget this.

"Fine... Not everyone appreciates good dealss..."

(Slug crewmember) Our Slug senses someone aboard the ship. Investigate it.

It looks like the merchant was trying to stall you while someone teleported on board. You catch him before he could finish and he teleports away. You immediately prepare for battle.

"Great. Let me show you our waress. It's not often I meet patient alienss, have this complimentary fuel as well."

"During our discussion, my man hass taken the liberty of disabling your weaponss to prevent any complications while completing our... transssaction..." You suddenly register multiple weapon locks, but your own weapons are not responding. Get out of there!

"Thank you. If you could do me one more courtesssy... please die quietly." You suddenly hear gunshots aboard the ship. He must have been stalling for time while they boarded your ship!

"Very well... Impatient alienss..." You prepare to jump.

You prepare to leave but notice noises in your ship. It looks like the merchant was trying to stall you while they hacked into your systems. You barely have time to order a red alert before a military ship flies through the clouds intent on your destruction!

Your sensors are no match for the Slug's telepathic abilities - a ship you never even saw opens fire from astern!

The Slug vessel you encounter here has obviously made a big score and is looking to test its new armaments. They picked the wrong ship to attack.

A Slug passenger ship hails: "Please, your worthy alien highnessesss, we are unarmed and sseeking asssylum." You approach cautiously, and weapons immediately spring from their hull!

A Slug ship - a rogue, you suspect - approaches, but when he sees you're Federation he thinks better of the sneak attack and fires everything he has.

Direct attacks are not preferred by the Slugs, but of the three you see at this beacon, one has the brass to make a move on your position!

The Mantis attack ship here looks to have been hunting Slugs on their home turf - a rare test of honor for the mightiest Mantis crews. Weapons up!

You're surprised to find a ship without Slug markings stranded all the way out here, and move in to provide assistance. When you see the pirate insignia on the hull you quickly reconsider.

Attack!

Keep your distance and hope they haven't seen you yet.

There are few more vicious beasts in the galaxy than a Slug with his back to the wall. The faltering ship armed with fire-weapons uses a remote hacking tool to try and disable your door system - they're going to burn you out!

Continue...

(Hacking System) Counter the remote hacking.

Your hacking system automatically counters the digital assault and you move in to fight the ship.

The Slugs here use a tactic you hoped you'd never see: they use a remote hacking satellite to sabotage your oxygen production system and then charge fire-weapons - you're going to suffocate!

(Improved Oxygen) Try to squeeze some extra power to the system.

Thankfully your improved subsystem is able to counter their hacking enough to keep the life support barely functional. That should keep you alive at least...

A Slug ship hails you: "We've detected some worrying radiation coming from your medical unit, perhaps you should take a look?" As he signs off, your system shuts off and their crew teleports aboard from a nearby station. They don't look like engineers.

(Improved Medbay) Try to squeeze some extra power to the system.

Fearing the imminent battle you desperately try to get the medbay working again. Its lights flicker back on and you turn to face the intruders.

You are able to undo the damage of their remote hacking satellite but it's taking everything your hacking system has. Time to take out the enemy the old fashioned way.

The ion storm here threatens to deactivate your core systems, a fact made all the worse for the largely unaffected Slug ships circling like space-vultures.

The Slug ship that descends into view as you enter the ion storm must have sensed your distress - defensive action!

You arrive in the middle of an ion storm. Slugs generally avoid these storms but you find one waiting in ambush. Prepare for a fight!

You find yourself stuck in the middle of an ion storm with a Slug ship just a short distance away, refusing all hails. You cautiously try to slip further into the clouds, but they turn suddenly to attack!

You arrive to find a Slug ship in the middle of boarding a disabled Rock freighter.

Engage the Slug ship.

Ignore them.

You charge weapons and the Slugs immediately back down. When you return to the freighter, the Rockmen have already repaired the worst of their damage and jump away without another word.

You charge weapons and the Slugs quickly change course to meet your charge.

You have no desire to provoke Slugs in their own territory. You leave them alone.

You have no desire to provoke the Slugs in their own territory. You leave them alone.

After the Slugs board the ship, you are surprised to see the Rock ship spring to life and decimate the other ship. They message you, "Pathetic. You are either a coward or an ally of the Slugs. Either way, you don't deserve to live."

It appears that the Rock ship left during your battle. You doubt they could have been more ungrateful for your assistance.

After the battle the Rock ship hails you. Their captain simply says, "Thanks." and jumps away. That's pretty gracious of them, considering the Rockmen's reputation.

It appears the Rock ship was long since abandoned. You strip what you can from it.

You arrive near the distress beacon's signal.

You track the distress beacon with difficulty to one of the five moons of a planet hidden in the nebula.

Investigate.

As you drift closer, you are contacted by a Slug marooned on the moon's surface. "I shall join your crew, sssay I, if you can answer me this simple quesssstion. How many moons are there in orbit here?"

Five.

Six.

Seven.

Eleven.

You track the distress beacon with difficulty to one of the six moons of a planet hidden in the nebula.

You track the distress beacon with difficulty to one of the seven moons of a planet hidden in the nebula.

You track the distress beacon with difficulty to one of the eleven moons of a planet hidden in the nebula.

"That issss... incorrect." Further, I have taken advantage of your lack of acuity to beam aboard your ship and steal your stuff!

"That isss... correct. You sssurprise me. Human, is it? Yesss... we can be partners." The Slug beams aboard and joins your crew!

The distress call appears to be emanating from a Slug ship caught in open space by a Mantis raider. They contact you on emergency frequencies: "Please, we'll give you all we have if you sssave ussss!"

Attack the Mantis ship.

You lock onto the Mantis ship and engage.

Attack the Slug ship.

You move to finish what the Mantis have started.

Of all the species in the galaxy, these two deserve one another. You power up the jump drive.

It doesn't look like they can stand much more damage. After a few shots their ship breaks apart and you move in to loot the remains.

The Slug captain hails you: "A misstake! A sssimple misstake. Of course we can pay you! Ssseee? An augmentation has already transported." You allow them to leave with their lives.

"You have besssted us! Will you accept what is in our storeesss in exchange for our livess?"

Let them live.

"Take thisss newly developed weapon we're transporting... They're not going to be happy we gave it up, that isss for ssure..."

Accept the prototype weapon.

This odd beam weapon does no damage to ships but instead greatly hurts the crew! Diabolical!

We don't want the weapon, we want information.

You ask where they were delivering the weapon. "By telling you we will probably die jussst as like as not... Oh well." They give you the coordinates of the a prototype cruiser's mobile construction platform.

We will not accept surrender!

You arrive to discover an impressive cruiser being worked on by a few smaller ships and guarded by an assault ship. The mobile construction platform is slowly slipping into the clouds. You have not yet been noticed.

Charge them before they escape.

As you approach, the assault ship swoops in on an intercept trajectory. Prepare for a fight!

Try to tail them without being noticed.

It's not long before they detect your presence. The assault ship moves in to attack!

(Cloaking) Cloak and slip into the clouds.

(Advanced Piloting) Quickly maneuver into the clouds and stay out of their detection range.

You slip into the nebula undetected but at this rate you are likely to get lost and lose track of them.

Fly slowly toward their last known position.

You are advancing slowly when suddenly the assault ship bursts through the clouds. They must have been able to detect you with their telepathy!

Wait and hope the escort leaves.

You wait for a time before attempting to advance toward the platform. However, after some frantic searching you can't tell if they left or you simply miscalculated your trajectory... You give up the search and prepare to leave.

(Slug Crew) Have your crewmember monitor their life signatures.

You try to stay just far enough away that they won't detect your life signatures without actively searching for you. After a time, your Slug tells you the ship with a larger crew has jumped away. He guides the helm toward the platform...

The only ship left near the cruiser is an interceptor. This should be easy!

(Improved Sensors) Try to maintain a lock on their ships from a distance.

You overclock your sensors, trying to get them to function in the clouds. They work just enough to let you keep tabs on their general position. After a time, the assault ship and most of the escort jumps away from the platform. You take the opportunity and move in to attack.

"Here! We have lotsss of fuel! Take it all"

They transfer a meager amount of material. "There... now keep your word..."

"Take it and leave ussss be."

The only thing that can render a nebula more dangerous is if it's also home to the Slugs. This particular nebula is just that.

This nebula is home to the telepathic Slugs. They'd sell their own slime for a crate of scrap, but they much prefer to just take it.

You're told the Slug home world is somewhere in this nebula. You can't see them, but you know they're watching.

The Slugs that live in this nebula field are a leisure-centered civilization. Everything in Slug life is done in the pursuit of more currency and more time in which to spend it on extravagant ventures. This, inevitably, leads to much treachery in open space.

The Slugs developed on an ocean planet where the ability to telepathically sense another organism was more important than sight. Today they use this ability to navigate unfettered the depths of the nebulas they inhabit.

A Slug captain hails and invites himself aboard your ship to present a flask of something slimy. "Now, most gracioussss captain, you must join me please in a drink to our alliance!"

Drink.

Refuse.

The Slug feigns offense at your refusal, but you sense that he respects your caution. This does not, however, prevent him from returning to his ship and opening fire.

(Rock Crew) Have your Rockman pose as captain.

You take a cautious gulp. It's foul, but doesn't do any lasting damage. It's a thousand to one chance, but this Slug actually seems to be trustworthy. He casually celebrates your newfound trust by repairing part of your ship and offering to sell you his wares.

You take one gulp and wake up with the rest of the crew in the cargo hold... which contains noticeably less scrap than before.

Even if there was something malicious in the drink, you doubt it would affect the Rock digestive system. The Slug casually celebrates your newfound trust by repairing part of your ship and offering to sell you his wares.

Your crewmember is able to identify a heavy anaesthetic contained in the flask when he feels slightly drowsy (the Rock digestion system is very robust). His ruse discovered, the Slug immediately returns to his ship and opens fire.

You arrive to the sight of two Slug ships in communication range. They don't see you.

Tap their comm frequency.

You overhear their conversation and learn they're planning to raid an infamous and likely wealthy pirate ship in the area. The pair jump off and you note down their target co-ordinates.

You have no interest in anything the Slugs could make business out of. Time to move on.

You catch up with the two Slug ships and they're already carrying out their raid! One is in close combat with the pirate, the other seems to be heading for a small space cache the pirate was protecting.

Suddenly the first ship bursts into flames, and an urgent call arrives from the remaining Slugs. "We sssugest you distract the pirate vesssel while we retrieve the valuables. Fifty fifty sssplit."

Engage the pirate.

There's money to be made here. The Slugs know that. You turn on the pirate and intercept just before he can reach the cache!

Head for the cache.

When he sees you making for the cache the Slug captain hails: "Foolish alienss, no eye for profit. Bessst of luck to you." They jump off, leaving you toe to toe with the pirate!

You detect life signs on a nearby moon - a lone Slug marooned on its surface. "Ah, a sssentient ssspecies, after all this time. I am Slocknog, a wandering hero ssseeking adventure. You may hire me for a ssmall sssum."

Hire Slocknog.

"I sssee you are a wise captain. I will enjoy this adventure." Slocknog buries the scrap somewhere deep within his folds of skin and joins your crew.

Slocknog

Ignore Slocknog.

You power up the FTL, at which point the Slug sends an urgent plea. "Please, I ssee you are a sssly captain. You have an advantage. Very well. I will join your crew - but please remove me from this rock!"

Rescue him.

When he sees the shuttle headed for his position the Slug thanks you with what looks like sincerity. He readily joins your crew.

Leave him.

You close the frequency and continue jump prep. If this Slug is such a hero he'll find a way off that moon on his own.

You find a Slug vessel broadcasting the distress signal and contact them. "Ah, yesss, we are having problems with our oxygen generation unit. Perhaps your crew can assist in repairsss?"

Send some crew to help.

You know better than to trust the Slugs. You cut communications and prepare to jump.

(Mantis Crew) Have your Mantis oversee the repairs.

Once on board, it becomes clear that nothing is wrong with their O2 system. Almost expecting this, your Mantis calmly responds to the trap. Once a couple of the Slugs have been spread across the walls of their ship, the rest surrender.

As soon as you board their ship their hostile intentions become clear. Despite being outnumbered, your crew is able to break free of the Slug trap and fight back to the airlock. You pull away from the enemy ship but not before a few Slugs make it on board.

As soon as you board their ship their hostile intentions become clear. On your way back to the airlock, one of your crewmembers is taken out by a well aimed Slug blaster shot.

Fortunately, your crewmember was immediately revived by the Clone Bay.

You cautiously board their ship and immediately smell the stale air of a malfunctioning life support. In no time at all you're able to fix up the problem and head off again with some extra scrap in your hold.

The distress signal originates from a tampered jump beacon. A Slug vessel jumps in and announces he has hacked your engines system. "Of course if you, as one of the few remaining ships in the Federation, swear allegiance to the Slug Empire you will be free to go."

Swear allegiance.

Never!

The Slug is unimpressed by your bravado and moves in to attack. Get the shields up, you're a sitting duck with malfunctioning thrusters!

(Improved Piloting) Override his control.

You quickly re-wire through a secondary control module. Once they realize you're not likely to agree to their demands they move in to attack.

"Wow, I didn't think you'd go through with it..." He turns to his second in command, "Looks like I owe you some scrap." Strangely enough, they simply let you pass.

Words come cheap, especially these ones. You assure the Slug of your loyalty and he welcomes you to the fold: "...and finally, let me introduce you to your new Slug Empire Overseer. He will ensure you stay true to the cause." A bored-looking Slug teleports over.

This nebula looks like it's recently seen two ships exchange fire... with mutually-assured destructive results. Wreckage drifts by your screens and tumbles into the depths of the nebula to be lost to sight. It's hard to determine who the combatants were without closer investigation.

(Slug Crew) Ask your Slug crew to scan for survivors.

Despite the destruction filling the system, your crewman is able to pick up the faint thoughts of a life form in the debris - it looks like they won't last much longer without help.

Assist the survivor.

Leave the battlefield before other ships arrive.

Investigate the battlefield.

As you investigate the battlefield, your ship is pummeled by drifting wreckage - unable to detect anything of interest, you decide not to risk any further damage to your hull and prepare to jump.

The wreckage is drifting faster than it first appeared. You barely avoid being pummeled by drifting wreckage - unable to detect anything of interest, you decide not to risk your ship and prepare to jump.

You spot a life form floating within the wreckage.

Your bring the survivor aboard, but discover their wounds are severe. They won't live much longer.

Make them comfortable for their final moments.

On their death bed, they croak out a series of coordinates and beg you to go there - when you attempt to ask them why, the survivor simply says, "ABADOTH" and perishes.

(Advanced Medbay) Get them into the medbay!

Using your upgraded medical bay, you are able to heal the survivor's wounds and they recover quickly. Grateful to be saved, they offer to join your crew and help however they can.

(Clonebay) Try to clone them before it's too late.

You clone the individual and let the host pass away. The clone decides to join you - although it has little choice in the matter.

You have arrived at the coordinates given to you by the dead crewman you attempted to save. There doesn't seem to be anything here - no planets, no vessels, and no clue as to what he meant by sending you here.

(Slug Crew) Ask your Slug crewmember to scan for life forms.

Do a full system scan - though you're sure to lose some of your lead with the Rebels.

You start the arduous task of a full system scan. This better be worth it.

A Zoltan ship decloaks and demands your reason for being here!

Explain about finding the dead crewman.

There is a moment of silence, and suddenly the Zoltan ship cloaks - must have been the wrong word to use... now you've got a fight on your hands!

(Engi Crew) Say ABADOTH.

Your Engi crewman easily recalls the phrase the deadman used from its memory banks. There is a moment of silence, and the ship's captain solemnly thanks you for the information. He wishes you well on your journey, and he offers several upgrades to assist you in exchange for your service to the Zoltan race.

Say ANODYNE.

Say ABADOTH.

There is a moment of silence, and the ship's captain solemnly thanks you for the information. He wishes you well on your journey, and he offers several upgrades to assist you in exchange for your service to the Zoltan race.

Say ABATODH.
