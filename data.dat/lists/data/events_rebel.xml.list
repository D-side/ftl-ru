This sector was bustling with activity just a few years ago. Now, more than half of the jump beacons have been destroyed, many settlements have been abandoned and the Rebels patrol constantly.

This sector was hit hard by the rebellion. The many alien settlements and stations located here are now watched over by almost an equal number of Rebel bases, heavy-handedly 'keeping the peace'.

Once the Federation forces were scattered, the Rebels came down hard on the locals here. Between the 'tax collectors' and military bases, the Rebel presence in this sector is high.

At one point this was one of the most commonly traveled sectors. Knowing that, the Rebels have stationed a number of fleets here. Be careful.

You will have to be very cautious in this sector. The Rebels have full control and are no doubt looking for you.

You discover a re-supply station used by Rebels and civilians alike. You transmit your fake ship identification and for once, they don't seem to recognize your ship. You try to assume the air of a local as you prepare to dock.

You arrive at a small space station that is putting out wide-band broadcasts on black-market channels. You doubt they would turn away any business, regardless of allegiances.

You receive generic advertisements from a nearby public ship-yard. It seems they are willing to work on any ship, not only those of Rebel hue.

You enter a system bustling with Rebel activity. Supply freighters and re-supply stations are dwarfed by a few heavy warships. Luckily, no one seems to be paying attention to small cruisers. No ships are scanning or messaging you.

You arrive near a small Rebel refueling depot. Your ship is being scanned multiple times so they must recognize you, but there appears to be no combat-ready ships in the vicinity. The only message you receive is a denial to your request to dock at the depot.

There is not much of interest nearby. A small sun in the distance with a few orbiting planets in nearby space provide little of interest.

There are no other ships near this beacon, however you detect a small communication relay. You tap into it without a problem; there is no encryption. Most of the chatter revolves around troop and fleet movements, not particularly interesting.

There is a small planet nearby with scattered settlements. A small Rebel fleet is in orbit with many ships ferrying back and forth. It must be a more recently 'liberated' planet.

You discover one of the Rebel's autonomous scouts. The ship's AI wastes no time in engaging your ship.

Your ship is hailed: "This is an automated message. Resisting our takeover is pointless. Prepare to die." It appears this Rebel ship is run by an AI.

A Rebel autonomous scout is exploring this beacon. You attempt to hide behind a nearby moon, but the ship finds you and begins its assault.

The AI of a nearby small Rebel scout immediately identifies you as a threat and engages.

A Rebel ship moves in to engage. You attempt to open communications, but realize the futility of that action when you see the ship is run by an AI.

This must be one of the Rebels' unmanned scout ships. Looks like there's no way around a fight.

Another unmanned ship patrols this area. You prepare the ship for combat.

This beacon is being patrolled by a unmanned scout. A fight is unavoidable.

A small shuttle appears on the local radar. Turns out it is a Rebel automated scout!

Your arrival is greeted by numerous computer alerts. The nearby automated Rebel scout has used a local satellite to deploy a virus to disrupt your Shields System. Hopefully it won't cause further problems before you can destroy it.

Continue...

(Hacking System) Counter the remote hacking.

Your hacking system automatically counters the digital assault and you move in to fight the ship.

Your ship is hailed. "We've found you at last. Prepare to die!"

A small Rebel ship is docked at a small station. You try to lay low but it spots you. Power up the weapons!

A Rebel ship has been patrolling this region. As soon as you arrive it begins its assault.

A Rebel ship hails you: "Federation scum! We've waited a long time for this!"

You receive a transmission: "Sorry sir, this is nothing personal but we're under orders." The Rebel ship's weapons go hot.

By the time you notice the Rebel ship behind the beacon, it's too late to avoid a fight.

A Rebel ship hails. "We did not fight a war to let a single Federation ship shatter our dreams of a better galaxy!" He locks weapons.

A Rebel ship approaches cautiously. "Personally," says the captain, "I'd have stuck with the Federation. But I'm a soldier, sir, and I'm no use without a war to fight. Raise your shields!"

You're hailed by a Rebel ship: "When the rebellion is complete you'll see the safer world we provide. Well, you won't, but you get the point." They arm weapons.

A Rebel ship is guarding this beacon. You order a pursuit course and prepare to scratch up one more.

You stumble across a forward scout of the Rebel fleet.

You come across a Rebel automated scout ship pursuing a civilian ship, weapons engaged.

Aid the civilian ship.

You power up your weapons and engage the automated ship.

Stay out of it.

The fight brings them out of your immediate scanning range.

You detect a Rebel scout on an attack approach to a small refueling outpost. Their weapons are charged, but they're not firing yet.

Intervene to defend the outpost.

The rebel responds to your threat, "I don't know who you are, but no one defies the Rebel Fleet!" They move in to engage.

Avoid the conflict.

The Rebel ship fires some warning shots but eventually powers down their weapons. The outpost seems to have given them what they demanded.

You detect an automated Rebel scout attacking a small refueling outpost.

Detecting the higher threat, the automated ship moves in to engage your ship.

You steer clear of the conflict. The outpost receives a beating but the ship stops its attack before it's destroyed.

You detect a Rebel automated ship nearby. It does not engage and seems to be patrolling around a long-range sensor station.

Attack the automated ship to get to the sensor station.

Avoid provoking the ship.

(Sensors) Use your sensors to attempt to access the data.

(Teleporter) Beam directly onto the station to try to avoid detection.

Once on board, your crew is able to access and download the long-range scanner's archived information. Your map has been updated.

Your improved Sensors are able to remotely access and download the public radar station's local map data.

The automated ship must be remotely connected to the station; as soon as you attempt to log on, the ship activates and charges you.

An advanced Rebel automated ship remains stationed near a small Rebel space-station. Sensors indicate it's a storage vessel for military goods.

Attack the automated ship to get to the storage cache.

(Cloaking) Attempt to cloak and access the cache.

The ship patrols wide around the area, successfully approaching the station while avoiding detection.

Before you can get close enough to scan the station, the automated ship detects you and moves in to attack!

The station was either abandoned or stripped clean. It seems to have lain unused for quite some time. You find nothing useful.

The station was apparently designed to outfit Rebel ships with Drone Systems. You find a functioning Schematic.

The station is a storage site for military grade weapons. You find one that can be easily attached to the ship.

The station is a storage site for various resources. You salvage everything possible.

A Rebel automated ship sits dormant near a Rebel forward radar station.

Approach the station.

The ship powers up and targets you.

Keep your distance and wait for the FTL to charge.

(Combat Drone) Send a drone to distract the automated ship.

Your combat drone attacks the automated ship and then retreats, luring it away. You quickly move up to the radar station to access it.

Your combat drone repeatedly fires at the automated ship. It can't break through its shields, but is at least enough of a distraction to allow you to access the radar station.

Before your drone has a chance to attack, the automated ship activates and shoots it down. It then detects your ship and moves in on your position.

You successfully hack into their system and transmit false information about your location. That should hold off the fleet for at least a little while.

The firewalls prove too difficult to bypass. As you are about to disconnect, you stumble across unprotected information about the surrounding beacons. Your map is updated.

You are unable to penetrate the computer's defenses. You give up and return to the ship.

As you attempt to hack in, you set off a hidden alarm system. It seems that now the Rebels must surely be aware of your position! You hasten back to the ship to jump away.

You spot a small Rebel ship nearby. It seems to have been re-fitted for transport rather than combat. It does not seem to want to engage you and your ship.

Demand the surrender of their goods.

You prepare to secure their cargo by force.

Avoid the ship.

They stay outside your weapons range, and eventually jump away.

You search the ship and discover that its cargo was new military-grade weaponry! It was somehow undamaged in the fight and can easily be mounted on the ship.

You search the remains of the ship, but only come across blueprints and debris from broken machinery. A shame, but you take what scrap you can salvage.

The ship was transporting weaponry. You find a piece still intact, despite the battle.

The ship was apparently transporting weaponry; however, nothing seems to have survived the battle.

Searching the remains, you find that the cargo was military-grade Drone Schematics! You bring them aboard to install in your ship.

The debris implies that the ship was carrying Drone Schematics, but unfortunately nothing remains. You do find functioning Drone Parts, however.

This ship's cargo was not salvageable. However, they seem to have been surveying the region; they possess detailed maps and data. You download what you can to the ship's map.

From the bits and pieces you find, you decide that this ship was gathering information. Nothing seems useful.

You detect faint life signatures from an intact piece of the hull. They were transporting prisoners, and the sole survivor offers to join your crew, as a first step on his path to get revenge.

The ship appears to have been transporting prisoners. Unfortunately they were all killed in the battle. You salvage what you can.

The ship was carrying military supplies. You pick up anything that looks salvageable from the debris.

With the crew dead, you search the ship. You find military-grade weaponry and take what looks most useful.

The ship refuses to fight, but you still detect life signatures. Apparently this was a prisoner transport. The single survivor offers to join your crew in exchange for their freedom.

This ship was apparently carrying information about the surrounding beacons. You download what you can to the ship's map, and scrap the rest of the ship.

Searching the remains you find that the cargo was military-grade Drone Schematics! You bring them aboard to install on your ship.

You find a Rebel automated scout floating near this beacon. Despite its pristine condition, it appears to be de-activated.

Attempt to download the ship's data stores.

Don't risk activating it, and just strip the ship for any useful scrap.

(Sensors) Remotely scan the ship.

You are able to pull all of the ship's data about this sector. Your map has been updated.

You accidentally reactivate the ship's AI. Its weapons immediately go online; prepare for a fight!

Your improved Sensors indicate that it's safe to hack into the drone. You upload its map data to your navigation system and strip the ship of useful materials.

Your improved Sensors indicate the ship is on standby, ready to activate at a moment's notice. Will you still attempt to access the ship's data?

Yes.

No.

You leave the ship alone and prepare to jump.

There appear to be a number of small stations nearby. Before you have time to scan them, warnings go off. A Rebel teleporter was used in one of the stations. You've been boarded!

You receive a message from a nearby Rebel station, "You have a lot of guts passing through our space, I'll give you that." He turns giving an order, "Kill their crew, I want that ship intact."

Your sensors warn of an incoming Rebel ship at the same time as you hear the telltale signs of a teleporter. You hear someone taunt from within the ship, "Ready to die? I sure am ready to get a promotion!"

Incoming message, "Hello Captain," says a Rebel in an officer's garb. "How very generous of you to turn yourself in. Prepare to be boarded. Come quietly and we may be lenient."

You receive a message on a low-band channel. "You're surrounded, just like the last of your Federation friends. Just die already." The enemy has teleported onto your ship!

You arrive at the beacon to find yourself in a huge Rebel shipyard, scaffolding and construction drones filling the sector! The entire system looks devoted to ship construction, the nearby planets and moons ruthlessly mined to harvest resources for a ship of immense size...

Look around.

Warning lights flash as scans identify the gigantic ship under construction - it's a second Rebel Flagship! This must be the secret shipyards where the first one was built, and you've accidentally stumbled across it! Even in its weakened state, the Rebel ship powers up... get ready, you've got a hell of a fight on your hands.

Leave immediately.

You feel the mission is the highest priority and it's too risky to stay in such a dangerous location.

While the second flagship was not yet finished, it doesn't make the battle any less of a victory... and you've crippled the Rebel fleet's strength considerably! While you don't overstay your welcome, you quickly salvage choice bits of metal, drones, and even an unusual object or two from the wreckage and prepare to jump!

As you are leaving you detect an interesting Federation ship signal. Apparently the Rebels were reverse engineering the advanced weaponry on a prototype Federation cruiser. You don't know how they captured the ship intact but you program its FTL drive to return the ship to the nearest Federation base. You just hope it gets there unharmed.

The Federation Cruiser has been unlocked and added to the hangar!

You detect no more lifesigns on the incomplete Flagship. You'd expect a ship of that size to have more security measures, but perhaps their computer systems aren't complete yet.

Pillage the ship for supplies.
