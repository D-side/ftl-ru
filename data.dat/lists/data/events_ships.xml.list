Contact the civilian ship.

No more life signs detected on the pirate ship. You hasten to contact the civilian ship.

We surrender! Take one of our slaves as tribute; if you destroy us they'll all die anyway!

Accept their offer.

Surrender is not an option.

The slave ship is destroyed. They won't continue their evil trade, but many lives were probably lost on that ship.

"Fine! Our previous offer was not generous enough, let's improve it."

Accept the more generous bribe and leave.

Reject the offer and continue your assault.

You've proved a sufficient match for the pirates; they are powering up their FTL and trying to get away.

The pirate has abandoned pursuit of both you and its former prey. You attempt to hail the damaged ship.

Continue...

The pirate explodes, leaving behind a substantial collection of useful scrap material. You go to examine the ship you just saved.

The pirates are all dead, leaving the ship dead in space. You scrounge what you can from their ship before contacting its former prey.

With the pirate ship disabled, your engines come online again. You salvage what you can from their ship.

They hail you, "We realize our ship is no match for yours. If you let us go we can make it worth your while."

Ignore their pleas and attack.

They look like they don't want to fight. They are trying to escape.

They hail your ship saying, "You win! We're not cut out for this!"

Let them live and then return to the settlement.

With the pirates dissuaded from their career path, you return to the settlement. "Thank you, they returned to us before you did. I don't think we'll need this anymore."

Forget your promise, they die!

With all of the would-be pirates dead, you think it best not to return to the settlement... You prepare to jump.

The pirate jumped away in search of weaker targets.

You contact the delivery ship, who are grateful for your assistance. They offer you a reward for saving them.

The ship obliterated, only scant fuel canisters can be scavenged from the wreckage before the ion storm clears and you have to jump away.

With the ship in one piece, you are able to salvage most of the fuel supplies before the ion storm clears and you have to jump away.

With the ship in one piece, you are able to salvage most of the ammunition before the ion storm clears and you have to jump away.

When the pirate ship looks ready to break apart you notice the Slug ship has secured the loot and is preparing to jump away!

Continue fighting the pirate.

It's best you finish this - but you wonder whether what the pirate is carrying will be as valuable as what the Slugs snuck off with.

Let the pirate escape and go after the Slugman ship.

The pirate's too badly damaged to pursue you, and you catch up to the Slugs before they jump. "Ah, of courssse, we would never leave without providing the agreed upon ssspoils." They transfer over a decent chunk of the profits and set off.

With the pirate defeated you scan the debris for anything useful. The Slug ship is long gone, spoils from the cache in hand.

With the pirate taken care of, you search again for the cache he was protecting, but it's lost in the clouds. You console yourself with the salvage from the well-armed pirate ship.

You salvage what you can from the broken ship.

Investigate the station.

You salvage what you can and approach the station. It is used to relay information to the Rebel Fleet. You could attempt to hack it to give the Rebels false information.

Attempt to manually hack into the station.

Don't risk it. Leave the station.

(Hacking) Use a drone to hack into the station.

You successfully hack into their system and transmit false information about your location. That should hold off the fleet for at least a little while. You also are able to download data about the surrounding beacons.

The ship starts to power up its FTL Drive. If it gets away, it will no doubt warn the fleet of your position!

The scout jumps away. It will certainly have informed the fleet of your position. You must get to the next sector as soon as possible!

The ship breaks apart and you feel relief in the knowledge that you will hopefully still be one step ahead of the fleet.

Careful! Sensors indicate that this automated ship is rigged to inform the fleet of your location if destroyed! It is better to avoid risk and leave it alone, otherwise the fleet will find you faster within this Sector.

The scout jumps away. It will certainly have informed the fleet of your position. You must get to the next Sector as soon as possible!

You scrap the wreckage.

With the threat gone, you contact the Federation outpost. They respond, "Our location has been compromised! Take everything you can and please drop our survivors off at the next station." One soldier offers to stay and fight.

You contact the station once the Rebel ship is destroyed. The lone survivor responds, "This base is no longer safe. Let me join your crew and I'll have the station's drones patch up your ship."

With the ship destroyed, you quickly collect useful resources.

Contact the Federation ship.

With the crew of the Rebel ship dead, you salvage what you can.

There's no time to salvage the enemy ship... You must jump away before the cruisers get in firing range!

You manage to retrieve a few precious fuel capsules. You hurry to jump away from the cruiser fire!

With the ship gone you search through the abandoned base for any signs of their destination but find none.

You take what you can from the debris.

A quick search of their communication logs shows that the tech you were searching for never passed through this base... It must have been a decoy! You strip what you can and prepare to jump.

With the ship gone, you search through the abandoned base for any signs of their destination but find none.

The Rebels destroyed, you pick the bones of their ship and wait for the small Engi ship to catch up.

The Mantis ship breaks apart.

Attempt to contact the Engi.

No more life signs detected on the Mantis ship. You hasten to contact the Engi.

With the hostile Engi ship destroyed you carefully extract as much fuel as possible from the wreckage.

With the hostile Engies subdued you carefully extract as much fuel as possible from the ship.

The Rock ship starts to power up their FTL drive. If we're going to earn their trust we must endure the heat for as long as they can!

As they jump away they relay coordinates to your navigation system. They must mean for you to follow them!

Their ship breaks apart and you feel a twinge of guilt. Perhaps they could have helped the Federation if this had gone another way. You scrap what you can and prepare to jump out of the heat.

Their ship goes quiet and you feel a twinge of guilt. Perhaps they could have helped the Federation if this had gone another way. You scrap what you can and prepare to jump out of the heat.

Attempt to contact the civilian ship.

KazaaakplethKilik fights to the last, and you pick the scraps from the corpse of his ship. You sense, though, that his death has left a great mystery unresolved.

You strip what you can and contact the Engi ships.

The Mantis defeated, you contact the weakened Slug vessel. "You ssseee," they begin, "we are most grateful, but, that isss, we do not currently have the liquid asssets to reward you at this time."

Leave them be.

These wretches aren't worth fighting. Time to spin up and jump off.

Finish them off.

The Mantis defeated, you contact the weakened Slug vessel. "You sssee," they begin, "we are most grateful, but, that isss, we do not currently have the liquid asssets to reward you at thiss time."

As you're salvaging the Mantis wreck the Zoltan security patrol returns with three other ships. You quickly salvage what you can and set off before they can stop you for questioning.

With the assault ship taken care of, you turn your attention to the construction platform. However, you find that it has long since disappeared into the clouds. You scrap what you can and prepare to move on.

The interceptor powers up its FTL drive in preparation to escape. At the same time, the cruiser's FTL drive does the same. They must be linked! Don't let them get away!

The interceptor jumps away with the cruiser linked to its FTL signatures. You were so close...

With the escort destroyed you take a look at your impressive prize. Your mission is too pressing to take a test flight. Before you rig the ship's computer to guide it back to the main Federation hangar you discover a unique augment that duplicates the Slug's ability to heal breaches!

With the Slug ship destroyed, you retrieve some scrap and return to the Rock ship.

With the Slugs no longer a threat, you strip the ship and return to the Rockmen.

The Zoltan captain sends an urgent hail: "Wait, this was all a test! A test that you passed! A diverse crew, working together, surely a sight to warm the heart of any dispassionate observer. Come, I shall join your crew!"

While you search the debris, you wonder what it was that could have provoked them to act so irrationally.

While you scrap their ship, you wonder what it was that could have provoked them to act so irrationally.

They are clearly not putting up a fight. Are you sure you want to destroy them?

You continue the assault.

Let them go.

You power down your weapons and after a time the ship slowly limps away. They refuse all communications. You can't help but feel somewhat guilty.

You can't help but feel somewhat guilty as you search through the debris. It was probably a trap... right?

You begin to strip their ship and don't find anything that would indicate they were on anything other than a peaceful mission. Perhaps you were too hasty.

You defeat your assailant, but the peace ship has jumped away in the commotion.

The Mantis are so grateful that they only take three quarters of the loot, leaving the rest for you. How civilized.

The Rebel contacts you. "Lovely, you've done our job for us! We'll let you live as thanks. However, I can't promise the fleet will show you the same courtesy." They jump off. You collect what you can from the remains of the Zoltan ship.

The Zoltan hail once the smoke disperses. "Thank you. We were led to believe Federation ideals died along with the Federation itself. Let us aid you a little, for old times' sake." You accept their reward and scrap, then collect some remains from the Rebel ship.

You salvage what you can from the ship.

The Zoltan looks deeply dissatisfied with your aiming and demands to be dropped off at your earliest convenience.

You salvage the remains and contact the wise man.

The crew of the enemy ship has been eliminated. You scrap what you can.

Their ship seems severely damaged and they look to be reconsidering the fight. Should you power down your weapons and explain that you mean no threat?

Stop the fight.

They accept your explanation and allow you to approach the fleet. It appears they are miners and colonists from a fringe settlement who are fleeing to more protected space after hearing reports of pirate and Rebel attacks.

They apologize for their hasty response to your presence and spend some time refueling and repairing both ships.

They wanted to pick a fight with you so that's what they'll get.

The Crystalline ship shatters and you pick what you can from the debris. The rest of the convoy used the time to put a significant amount of distance between you and them. Nothing left to do but jump.
