The Rebel fleet has caught up to you. You detect significant fuel reserves in one of their closer fighters and move in to attack. Maybe you can still pull this off.

Your pilot deftly avoids incoming artillery fire from the surrounding fleet while you try to sort out exactly what your plan is... One of the many approaching fighters gets into weapon range and your scanners detect it has surplus fuel. Maybe you can still pull this off.

Continue...

As you are keeping a low profile, you're certain that the Rebel fleet is having a hard time tracking your ship.

Since your distress beacon has not been activated, you feel confident that the Rebel fleet is having difficulty tracking you. It should buy you a little time.

Long range scanners indicate the Rebel fleet has temporarily paused its advance on your position. Your decision to leave the distress beacon deactivated was farsighted.

Scanners show that the Rebel fleet has ceased its pursuit for a short time.

Your intuition as captain is telling you that the Rebels are having a hard time trying to find your ship.

Without a distress beacon or any FTL signatures to trace, you're sure that the Rebels are struggling to find you. You can only hope their confusion lasts until more fuel can be found.

The Rebel fleet seems to be unable to locate your ship's signature. If only you could get some fuel, you might still have a chance to place some distance between you and them...

No ship is in scanning range and no one arrives at the beacon.

Your waiting yields nothing while the fleet surely gets closer...

A freighter suddenly arrives nearby. They are so close you can almost wave at them, but your hails are ignored and the ship quickly jumps away.

Small traffic passes within a short distance of you, but no one responds to your hails.

The only ship within hailing range appears to be a civilian vessel. However, it quickly leaves once it picks up your signal.

As you wait, a small asteroid storm pelts softly against your shields and hull.

You begin to wonder if turning on the beacon would be worth the risk of detection. The fleet slowly approaches.

You contemplate the vastness of space.

The prolonged wait in empty space is causing tension among the crew. Still no contact.

Cabin fever begins to spread among your crew.

Long range scanners detect a small settlement, but they refuse all contact.

Gladly trade.

Respectfully decline.

A merchant ship jumps into the sector and you quickly hail them asking for help. They respond, "Perhaps we could work out an exchange..."

A number of ships pass through the sector. You relay your message to each, and one finally responds. "I can't help much right now but perhaps we can trade."

A nearby settlement sends a small ship in your direction. It keeps its distance and hails you, "We can give you fuel for a price. Just don't even think of doing anything rash. We've got a teleporter at our base and a squad ready to defend us.

A large caravan of merchant ships jumps to a location near your position. Sensing an opportunity, one ship breaks off from the fleet to offer you an exchange.

A modified YT-1300 freighter jumps to an area near your sector. Your gut tells you these people are smugglers, but they seem to be feeling altruistic and present an offer of assistance.

Although your lack of fuel cells prevents your ship from jumping, you can still use your impulse engines. Will you spend some time exploring the nearby system?

Explore the nearby area.

Stay near the beacon.

You happen across a small asteroid field near the beacon.

Approach the asteroid field to scan it.

Avoid the risk.

You find a small outpost for local travelers, but it seems few ships in this area employ FTL drives. Their stock of fuel cells is small and their price high, but beggars can't be choosers...

Trade 20 scrap for 5 fuel.

You gladly make the trade.

Trade 10 scrap for 2 fuel.

This fuel won't last long, but you gladly make the trade.

Trade 5 scrap for 1 fuel.

This fuel won't last long, but at least you can jump to another beacon.

Don't make a trade.

No ships respond to your hails and you find nothing of interest.

You wander within scanning range of a small Rebel automated scout!

A ship approaches. They hail you saying, "You need some fuel? We'll prepare to dock to help."

Graciously accept their offer.

Request that they keep their distance.

(Advanced Sensors) Run a detailed scan with your sensors before responding.

(Long-Ranged Scanners) Run a detailed scan before responding.

They pull close to your ship and unload some fuel saying, "Try not to run out of fuel again. These are dangerous times; who knows who could have showed up."

They approach and dock with your ship. On board they present an offer.

As their ship pulls up next to yours, their captain continues, "Yes, we'll certainly help... Help to relieve you of that nice ship!" Sensors detect a hidden teleporter has been activated. We've been boarded!

As they approach, you detect their weapons powering up. It seems their intentions are hostile!

"I assure you that we mean no harm. See, we'll send some fuel over on a transport." A small ship docks and offloads some fuel just as they said. They leave, saying, "Stay cautious, friend."

"No one trusts anyone these days..." The ship jumps away.

They reply,"Keep our distance? Let's see if you can stop us!" They power up their weapons and advance.

Sensors indicate their ship is without military-grade weaponry, even small arms. You allow them to dock and they give you some fuel saying, "I remember a time when we didn't have to be so paranoid about each others' intentions... Stay safe."

Sensors are picking up armed crew and considerably more weaponry than is legal for a craft of this size. This is surely a trap.

Power up weapons and prepare for a fight.

(Cloaking) Cloak and get out of scanning range before they have a chance to lock on.

Your highly advanced cloaking system allows you to get out of range easily since they were still out of firing range. Eventually the ship jumps away.

The Rebel fleet seems to be unable to locate your ship's signature. If only you could get some fuel, you might still have a chance to place some distance between you and the Rebels...

You contemplate that it is fortunate the ship's life support system does not rely on FTL fuel cells.

Nothing happens. Your calls go unanswered.

The distress beacon's light is the only movement visible outside the ship.

No ships jump into the sector...

A few passing ships seem oblivious to your distress call and ignore all hails.

A few civilian ships are within scanning range, yet none respond to your calls.

No ships pass through the area.

A small ship arrives with a message, "This automated ship will provide refueling services once a monetary exchange is complete. Complimentary amounts of fuel are available in emergencies only."

Request emergency fuel reserves.

"This ship has registered that your one-time complimentary emergency fuel allowance has been consumed."

Buy 5 fuel for 20 scrap.

"Automated refueling complete."

Buy 2 fuel for 8 scrap.

Attack the automated ship.

A merchant ship jumps into the sector, obviously responding to your ship's distress beacon. They hail you offering a trade for fuel.

A ship arrives at the beacon. "We noticed your distress signal. I assume you're out of fuel? We're a bit low ourselves but perhaps we can make a trade."

A ship traveling near the beacon approaches your ship and hails you. "Out of fuel? This is a good opportunity for both of us... Care to trade?"

A mercenary ship arrives at the beacon. "We have a bit of extra fuel we can give you... for a price."

They respond: "Seeing that you're in need, is this trade acceptable?"

Accept the offer.

Decline again.

"I'm not doing this for charity, you know," says their captain. "This is the only other way I'll part with my fuel."

Their captain disconnects from the channel and without another word their ship prepares to jumps away.

Before they jump away, their captain says, "I'm sorry, but we are unable to help in any other way."

They take pity on you and offer you some fuel free of charge.

They end the discussion and prepare to jump away.

A Rebel ship hails you, "Hello citizen. We are responding to your distress call and can assist... Wait a second... You're that ship! Prepare to die!"

A Rebel ship jumps nearby, "I wasn't looking forward to patrolling this boring sector but here you are, the most wanted ship in the area, just asking for me to find you. It looks like it's my lucky day!" They power up their weapons.

Your distress beacon must be working because a ship just jumped nearby. You run a scan on it and activate a red alert. It's a Rebel fighter!

A Rebel ship jumps in and hails you, "I knew you would slip up some time. Surrender quietly!"

A ship responding to your distress moves in. Unfortunately it turns out to be an automated Rebel scout. It immediately reverses thrust after scanning your ship.

As you drift through space an Engi ship passes through. From listening to their com channel it sounds like they're discussing making repairs on their ship.

Hail them.

Ignore them.

They clearly are busy because they don't notice your ship at all.

(Hull Repair Drone) Offer to help repair their hull.

They happily accept your offer for help. Once the drone does its work they transfer over some fuel for your trouble.

The Engi respond to your signal. "Identity: Federation. I/O error: Federation = [void]." All further hails go unanswered.

The Engi fail to respond, but move to intercept. You detect abnormal electromagnetic signals aboard the ship - someone has reprogrammed them to fight!

The Engi respond to your signal. "Your need: fuel. This unit's need: scrap. Exchange beneficial. Exchange permitted?

Make the trade.

You make the exchange and the Engi leave without another word.

Decline.

The Engi coolly cut communications and continue on their journey.

Upon discovering your need, the Engi gladly offer some of their extra fuel reserves. It's amazing how altruistic these robotic creatures can be.

A Mantis ship hails you, "Looks like we found the poor fools that need some help. Come brothers, let's 'help' them!" They move in to attack.

Before long a ship jumps nearby, no doubt responding to your beacon. However any relief you felt disappears as soon as you recognize that the ship is of Mantis design. Prepare for a fight.

You detect a Mantis ship approaching and hack into their comm channel and hear, "...hope they put up more of a fight than the last Federation ship. This has been a disappointing day so far." Looks like they're not here to help.

A Mantis ship jump nearby. Sensors detect weapon locks and all hope of avoiding a fight fades away.

As you await either salvation or death, your attention is drawn to a sea of debris drifting past the starboard view port. The chunks gliding by grow bigger in size until the stern of a Rock frigate, gutted in some distant war, comes into view.

Send an away team.

Perhaps there's some viable fuel left on board; a small away team boards the vessel.

Report!

Let it drift by.

The Rock don't take kindly to aliens picking through their belongings, no matter how decrepit they may seem, and you don't take risks in Rock territory.

(Life Scanner) Run additional scans.

The ship appears to be entirely lifeless. Your crew is able to find some usable fuel cells after a brief search.

A short time later the team returns with a stash of ammunition and scrap - but all the fuel on board is long gone.

One of the crew reports that the main computer was housed in this section and is still partially operational. They're able to download local telemetry as well the location of the ship's reserve fuel! Your map has been updated.

The team returns home rather sooner than expected. Turns out just as they were making entry to the frigate, the ship's emergency fuel cell just happened to drift by!

The away team reports in, but then screams are heard and the comm goes dead! When it comes back online a Rockman can be heard - he's the lone survivor from the frigate's crew, and completely mad. He demands you pay a scrap ransom in return for your crew-member's life!

Pay.

Despite his fragile condition, the Rockman is good to his word and returns your crew-member, who is suitably grateful. Sadly, gratitude doesn't power the FTL drive.

Refuse.

It's a tough call, but it's for the Federation and the liberty of all. You set off before you can change your mind.

Before preparing to jump you check the Clone Bay but there is no sign of activity.

A curious Rock ship comes in for a closer look at you. They refuse all hails.

Attack.

The Rock people are not renowned for their generosity. If it's fuel you need, it's fuel you must take!

Wait and see.

The Rock ship circles yours, running scans on your systems. You fear the worst, but the scans pause on your fuel tank. They obviously have no wish to communicate, but they transfer over a cache of fuel before flashing their lights and jumping away!

The Rock ship circles yours, running scans on your systems. Your worst fears are confirmed when they identify your engines and teleport a bomb straight onto it! Combat ready!

The ship jumps away without a word. You hope they didn't leave to get reinforcements.

You take care to salvage as much fuel as possible from the wreck.

A poorly armed Slug ship cruises by and offers assistance. Their captain seems to be chuckling to himself, perhaps at the prices he's charging.

Pay 15 scrap for 5 fuel.

Ignore the offer.

You know better than to do business with a Slugman who seems like he knows something you don't. He jumps off with another chuckle.

(Slug Crew) Have your Slug make the purchase.

As soon as he sees your crewmember the Slug stops his incessant chuckling. The exchange appears to go smoothly although you wonder what mental battles are telepathically occurring between the two Slugs.

You doubt he is trustworthy but have no choice but to make the deal. However you complete the exchange without event.

Everything looks secure but suddenly a number of supplies disappear! He must have planted a portable teleporter into your cargo bay somehow. Before you can react his ship is long gone.

A mobile Slugman fuel depot enters scanning range. "My prices are fair, but I ask one thing - do not insult me with negotiation!" You check out his price list.

Buy 5 fuel for 50 scrap.

The trader looks shocked. You're struck by the sense that this is the first time anyone's ever paid him these prices.

Buy 10 fuel for 95 scrap. (BEST DEAL!)

Negotiate.

You offer a more reasonable price but the Slugman is outraged! He moves in to attack!

A refugee ship fleeing the Rebel advance enters the system, having picked up your distress beacon. While it doesn't have much fuel to spare, it recognizes you are part of the Federation and offers to split its remaining fuel with you.

A refugee ship fleeing the Rebel advance enters the system, having picked up your distress beacon. While it doesn't have much fuel to spare, its hull looks damaged - it is in bad need of scrap and is willing to trade fuel for it.

Trade some scrap for fuel.

The refugees thank you for the parts, and gladly pass along the much-needed fuel. They wish you well on your mission, and declare their support for the Federation.

(Engi Crew) Negotiate a better trade.

Your Engi analyzes scans of the extensive damage to their hull, calculating potential repair costs. The refugees grumble and protest, but in the end, they admit that their need for repairs is greater than their fuel surplus and offer a better trade.

Accept it.

Refuse it.

Refuse their offer.

The helpless refugees make easy targets. Attack them.

Panicked, the refugees immediately surrender as your weapons power up. They pass along their fuel and what few other supplies they have left in exchange for their lives.

The refugee ship cuts communications and jumps from the system without another word, the galactic equivalent of giving you the cold shoulder.

The refugees become desperate at your refusal - apparently, their hull is even more damaged than it first appears. Almost begging, they offer a better trade than before.

Refuse their offer again.

A refugee ship fleeing the Rebel advance enters the system, having picked up your distress beacon. While it doesn't have much fuel to spare, it is bad need of armaments and is willing to trade for them.

Offer some missiles for fuel.

The refugee ship makes the exchange, and wishes you well on your mission.

Having traded supplies, the ship suddenly powers up and attacks - it's a pirate ship!

The refugee ship apologizes, but they need their fuel. They wish you well, and then vanish from the system.

Sensing your reluctance, the refugee ship nevertheless parts with a small amount of fuel. It warns you to leave the sector as quickly as possible before it is overtaken by Rebels, then it jumps and vanishes to parts unknown.

Taking your reluctance as weakness, the refugee ship suddenly bristles with weapons - it's a pirate ship, and it believes it's found easy prey!

A refugee ship fleeing the Rebel advance enters the system. It seems surprised to see you stranded, and admits it was following you from afar in the hopes of you leading it to Federation space. While it doesn't have much fuel to spare, it recognizes you are part of the Federation and offers to split its remaining fuel with you.
