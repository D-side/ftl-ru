Charge L

When you arrive at the beacon you discover what must have been remnants of a large battle. However the vast majority of metal has been stripped from the ships, only various plastic and other materials float in a ring around a planet. A lone Lanius ship moves between the wreckage looking for more salvage.

The ship suddenly disables their weapons. There's no explanation and they don't respond to hails. It seems during the battle they lost some fuel cells from their storage. You quickly collect it and leave.

You arrive at one of the Rebel bases that the Engi told you about. It appears abandoned except for one scout ship. Perhaps you could extract information from them.
