Testing Crystal Teleport

Travel to the Crystal Sector

The ship suddenly disables their weapons. There's no explanation and they don't respond to hails. It seems during the battle they lost some some fuel cells from their storage. You quickly collect it and leave.

The ship jumped away without warning, you prepare to pursue.

With your teleporter damaged and no way to fix it, you take one of the enemy ship's shuttles to return to your own ship.

While waiting for help, you drained what little power you had left to pull away to a safe distance from the sun.

The ion storm died down, leaving your ship in peace as you wait for help.

While waiting, you managed to navigate out of the asteroid field using only your impulse engines.

Your ship already has this augment and its effect cannot stack. You break it down into scrap.

The data you carry is vital to the remaining Federation fleet. You'll need supplies for the journey, so make sure to explore each sector before moving on to the next. But get to the exit before the pursuing Rebel fleet can catch up!

The last hope of the Federation dies as your ship breaks apart.

Dummy

Welcome to FTL! You are the captain of a Federation starship on a very important mission.

The Federation is currently being torn apart by vicious Rebels. Your ship is carrying data vital to the defense of the Federation.

You will be traveling through dangerous sectors of the galaxy with the Rebel fleet in hot pursuit. Make it to the exit beacon of each sector before the Rebels can catch you.

Start Tutorial.

Looks like you need some more help to get through his shields! Some events can provide items. This one is providing you with an Artemis Missile Launcher.

Every new location will have an event like this. You might have multiple choices available to you at an event. In this example, a weak pirate ship is trying to destroy you.

Special BLUE choices like these are unlocked by having certain upgrades or equipment. They are nearly always a good choice.

You destroyed the pirate ship. As salvage, you gain (from left to right) some Fuel, Missiles, Scrap and another weapon! Note the reward resource icons correspond to your reserves along the top of the screen.

You killed all of the pirates! As salvage, you gain (from left to right) some Fuel, Missiles, Scrap and another weapon! Note the reward resource icons correspond to your reserves along the top of the screen.

Your ship cannot support any more active crew-members. You apologize and leave the extra crew at the nearest friendly outpost. They pay you for your troubles.

Welcome to a new sector! Get to the exit beacon and jump to the next sector before the pursuing Rebels catch you!

You've arrived at the Long-Range Beacon. When the FTL Drive is charged you can jump to the next Sector.

This Long-Range Beacon is almost hidden within a nebula. When the FTL Drive is charged you can jump to the next Sector.

The Rebel fleet has found you, and a nearby scout turns to engage. The cruisers in the distance are firing on you!

Another ship approaches, the reinforcements seem endless! You must jump away!

You've found the exit beacon but the Rebels got here first! You must survive long enough to be able to jump to the next sector.

The Rebel fleet has found you, and a nearby scout turns to engage. You must flee before their cruisers open fire!

Your jump leads you to nothing but empty space. This Jump Beacon serves no purpose other than as a connection.

You jump into an unremarkable system. No life signs detected within scanning range.

Your scans reveal a mining base on a nearby planet long since abandoned. No life signs detected.

Your scans reveal an ore refinery and several factories, all standing still and empty. No life signs detected.

You discover a nearby planet speckled with settlements, although none respond to your hails.

This beacon has been built for a nearby civilian space-station. No one hails your ship.

The nearby planet shows sign of habitation and great beauty. A rudimentary automated planetary defense system is looping its message into space: "Warning! Quarantine Level 5 in effect under FHA Act 22, article 11.2. Warning! Quarantine Level 5..."

Your jump leads to a completely unremarkable binary star system. There is nothing else around.

Your jump leads to a remarkable binary star system. The view is beautiful, but there is nothing else around.

Scans reveal a large asteroid field nearby. Short-range scanners may discover useful materials while we wait for the FTL to recharge.

Explore the asteroid field.

Too dangerous. We'll just wait for the FTL to charge.

(Scrap Recovery Arm) Attempt to mine the asteroids.

You carefully extract as much usable material as possible from the nearest asteroids while waiting for the FTL to charge.

A brief exploration yields nothing of interest.

Scans reveal a number of asteroids with useful compositions. You extract some fuel.

You discover the remains of ship embedded into an asteroid. It still has some functional missiles.

You happen upon an abandoned mining site. A few mining drones were left behind and could be repurposed.

The asteroid field proved more dangerous than expected. Some asteroids managed to get through your ship's defenses.

A pirate ship hiding behind one of the larger asteroids attacks you!

Hire the mercenary to delay the Rebels.

The mercenary ship masks its jump signature to mimic your own and then jumps off in the opposite direction. This should keep the Rebels guessing.

Hire the mercenary to scout the sector.

Your map has been updated.

Fight the ship.

Mercenaries are worse than Rebels. The only honorable course is to engage the mercenary in battle.

You have no need of his services.

You find a mercenary for hire at this Beacon. Their unique skills can sometimes prove to be useful.

A mercenary hails you: "Greetings, friend! We've heard tell of your quest and are here to offer our valuable services."

There's a ship with pirate markings orbiting the nearby planet. You receive his hail: "Anything is possible, for the right price."

The captain of this ship claims he can provide "services" as long as you've got the scrap.

Mercenaries are swarming the galaxy now, knowing that their less-than-legal services are in demand during this period of unrest. One is waiting at this beacon and hails you.

A ship hails you: "Good sir! It seems you're having some troubles with the Rebels. I'd like to help you, but I can't afford the upkeep required on this hunk of junk I'm flying... maybe we can come to an arrangement?"

Scans show a remote settlement being blockaded by a pirate ship. The ship hastily messages you, "Stay out of this, or you'll be next!...Concentrate fire on..."

Attack the pirate.

"You asked for it!" They pull away from the planet and move in to engage.

Ignore them.

It's just not possible to save every civilian affected by this war. You prepare to jump.

(Fire Beam) Show the pirate how to intimidate settlers: burn their crops!

The pirate watches as you start to light the meager crops on fire. In a few moments the settlement surrenders, offering tribute to leave them alone. The pirate seems impressed.

(Fire Bomb) Show the pirate how to intimidate settlers: start fires in their crude dwellings.

The pirate watches as you teleport an incendiary explosive into the settlement. As the settlers scramble to put out the fires, their rudimentary planetary defenses power down. Forcing their surrender was laughably easy, but the pirate seems impressed with your tactics and agrees to share the settlement's 'tribute'.

With the pirates gone you signal the station. "We appreciate what you've done, but there'll just be another ship looking to profit from our isolation soon enough. Sorry we can't give you more."

"Alright! We give up! We're terrible at this pirating thing anyway..."

Let them go.

Piracy cannot be forgiven. Attack!

They look like they don't want to fight. They are trying to escape.

You pick through the remains and contact the settlement.

Give them the fuel.

You give them the fuel.

Apologize, wish them luck, and continue on.

"We understand... Please send help our way if you meet anyone trustworthy."

"Thank you so much! We don't have much to offer, but have a look at the sector scans we took." Your map is updated.

"Thank you. Here, have this extra scrap as payment."

"Thank the Gods. We can finally get out of here! We're jumping straight home so take this extra weapon. We won't need it, hopefully."

"Thank you. Perhaps as payment our engineer can try to optimize your ship's reactor output?"

"Greetings! It is so good to see you! We've been out of fuel and floating out here for weeks. We were terrified a pirate or those damn Rebels would find us first. Could you spare some fuel?"

You arrive to find a ship floating among some debris. "Hello. Our impulse drives are shot and we can't jump. Could you give us some fuel?"

A small civilian ship flies over as soon as you arrive. You're prepared to fight but they just inform you that they're out of FTL fuel and can't jump.

"Hello. We used our last FTL fuel to jump to this station." They indicate a burnt out husk of debris and warped metal. "As you can see the war must have spread to this sector. We've been stranded ever since."

The ship emitting the distress beacon messages you, "Sorry to bother you, but we're out of fuel and can't get out of this barren sector. Could you help us out?

The distress beacon is coming from a civilian ship. It appears it is being chased by a pirate.

Aid the civilian ship.

You power up your weapons and engage the pirate ship.

Stay out of it.

The fight brings them out of your immediate scanning range; however, after a time the distress calls stop.

(Improved Weapons) Fire a warning shot from your strongest weapon.

Detecting the greater threat (and potential reward), they turn and engage your ship.

It seems the pirate wasn't looking for a fight with someone who could fight back. They leave and you move to contact the civilian ship.

It appears the distress beacon is coming from the surface of a nearby moon. Your sensors are picking up a single life form.

Go down to the surface to investigate.

Ignore the signal.

You find a colony that seems to have been recently attacked. Exploring the devastation, you find a lone survivor.

Invite him to join your crew.

Take him home to his family on a nearby planet in this system.

You find a man living alone in a cave. From the appearance of his wrecked ship, it seems he's been here for many years. He looks healthy, but his mental state is questionable.

Bring him back to your ship in hopes of finding some help for him.

Leave the madman to his ravings, he's not worth the risk.

(Improved Medbay) Bring him to your medbay.

Once inside your medbay, the system is able to restore his body and undo some of the damage to his brain. Once awake he states, "I feel almost like my old self again... Thank you. Please let me serve on your ship."

Charlie

(Advanced Medbay) Bring him to your medbay.

Once inside your advanced medbay, the system is able to identify and minimize the trauma associated with being alone for so long. Once awake he states, "I don't know how to repay you, I feel 10 years younger... Let me serve on your ship."

(Slug Crew) "Sir, allow me to assess his mental state."

The family apparently owns one of the most valuable mining enterprises in the sector. For the safe return of his son, the patron of the family offers you a substantial reward.

The survivor's family is of modest means, yet they manage to offer you a reward for your virtuous deed.

Overjoyed with the return of their son, the family of the survivor arranges to repair your ship's hull as compensation.

Once back in orbit, the man turns increasingly violent. Eventually he turns on your crew and manages to kill one before you can subdue him.

Luckily, your clone bay is able to revive your crewmember.

He seems to improve immensely upon getting back to the ship. It might take a while for him to truly be well again, but until then he seems happy to serve as a member of your crew.

Being back in space terrifies him. He goes mad and nearly blows a hole in the side of your ship with a makeshift explosive in an attempt to "escape this metal prison." He dies in the explosion.

It seems he was in worse health than we first thought. He collapses on the trip up to the ship. It doesn't look like he's going to make it...

(Improved Medbay) Quickly bring him to the medbay.

Your improved medbay was able to resuscitate him. After a short time he recovers greatly saying, "I really thought I was a goner... I haven't eaten for days. Would you mind if I stayed on your ship?"

(Improved Clonebay) Quickly register him into the clonebay.

Your quick reaction allowed your Clonebay to revive him after he passes. After he steps out of the machine he states, "How am I alive? Wasn't I just dying on some shuttle? Technology sure has changed."

You bring the ship closer. The Slug enters a trance-like state for 1 to 2 seconds, then quickly snaps out of it. He states, "This person is clearly unstable. It is best we leave them alone."

You bring the ship closer and the Slug, after a pause, says that the person is stable and with good intentions. You offer a position in your crew and it is graciously accepted.

He states that he was a weapons operator before being stranded. He happily offers his services for a time in exchange for "getting off that rock".

He states that he was a shield operator before being stranded. He happily offers his services for a time in exchange for "getting off that rock".

He states that he was a pilot before being stranded. He happily offers his services for a time in exchange for "getting off that rock".

He states that he was an engineer before being stranded. He happily offers his services for a time in exchange for "getting off that rock".

He states that he was an infantryman before being stranded. He happily offers his services for a time in exchange for "getting off that rock".

He states that he was a shipwright before being stranded. He happily offers his services for a time in exchange for "getting off that rock".

You arrive at the beacon and immediately detect a pirate ship. It seems this distress beacon was a trap!

"Haha! I knew someone would fall into our dastardly trap!" It appears this distress beacon was nothing but a decoy for a pirate ambush.

Your cockpit lights up with warning signals. You are being targeted by a nearby ship. The distress call was a lure to attract unwitting ships into weapons range. You prepare for a fight.

As soon as you arrive at the distress signal, shots are fired toward your ship. A trap!

You follow the distress beacon to a tiny asteroid belt. You find a small ship struggling to maneuver through the field.

Hail them to offer assistance.

They respond: "Help! Our shields are down and we won't last long!"

Try to shield their ship with yours.

Don't risk our ship. Leave them to their fate.

(Defense Drone) Use a Defense Drone to protect their ship.

(Repair Drone) Send a Repair Drone to fix their Shields.

(Teleporter) Offer to beam them aboard your ship.

(Rock Armor) Shield their ship with yours and escort them out.

You succeed in preventing them from being entirely destroyed, your improved hull taking the brunt of the asteroids that make it past your defenses. They offer you some of the scrap and fuel they were mining out of the asteroid as thanks.

You succeed in preventing them from being entirely destroyed, but your ship took a number of hits in the process. They offer some of the scrap and fuel they were mining out of the asteroid as thanks.

You try your best but one stray rock hits a key structure in their ship. It breaks apart in front of your eyes. You salvage what you can before leaving, and try not to think about the lost crew.

Despite your best efforts, the civilian ship breaks apart from the constant barrage. You are barely able to break out of the asteroid field yourself. The ship sustains some damage in the process.

Your drone succeeds in keeping their ship from breaking apart while they fix it, however you take some damage while attempting to leave the asteroid field. They offer you some military supplies as thanks for saving them.

The drone keeps the ship stable enough to allow them to escape the asteroid field. They message you with map coordinates, "You're that Federation ship the Rebels are after, aren't you? I can't offer much but I heard there was a Federation loyalist base nearby. Maybe they can help you?"

They reluctantly agree. Once aboard, you watch as their ship crashes against a massive rock. They thank you, but say "I don't know what we'll do without our ship. As the Captain, I feel obligated to help you with your mission."

They refuse at first, but after another blast rocks their ship they agree and beam aboard your ship. They say, "Thank you but we really should return to our families... I'm sure we can muster up a reward if you take us home."

Take them to the nearby planet, where they're from.

You regretfully leave the area, not able to watch them get destroyed. A short while later you get a second message, "We survived, no thanks to you! Don't think I don't know that the Rebels are hunting for you. I'll be sure to tell them where you are the next time I see them!"

You watch helplessly as their ship smashes against a cruiser-sized rock...

Once you arrive at the location of the distress call a civilian ship hails you, "Thanks for responding to our beacon. Our FTL navigation has gone haywire and we can't plot a course to the nearest depot to get it fixed. Could you lead us there?"

Lead them to their destination.

"Take this bit of scrap as a down-payment. We'll use your jump signatures to follow you. You're really helping us out here."

Decline.

"Alright... If you're not going that way I guess it can't be helped. We'll just wait for the next ship to come."

(Advanced FTL Navigation) Have your navigation software calculate and upload route instructions to their ship.

"We're receiving your transmission... Wow, I didn't know that chain-jumping was possible with this class of ship. We'll get back in a single jump! Thank you so much, please accept this."

Aid the Federation ship.

You power up your weapons and engage the Rebel ship.

Use this chance to escape.

The Rebel's preoccupation with the Federation ship allows you to slip away undetected. However you can't help but feel you should have helped them.

Upon arriving at this beacon, you detect a distress call. Local scans reveal that a Federation transport is under attack from a Rebel scout!

You immediately notice a Rebel ship chasing what appears to be a civilian transport. However you are detecting chatter on an encrypted Federation channel... That transport is carrying Federation loyalists!

Your sensors are picking up a distress call on an encrypted Federation channel. You eventually find a Federation scout being chased by a Rebel fighter!

"Thank you for saving us. This ship is transporting Federation civilians on the run from the rebellion and we don't have the equipment to fight for ourselves. I don't have much to offer, but I can inform you of a hidden Federation base nearby. Perhaps they can assist you more."

Their ship looks to be on the verge of destruction and life signs are fading quickly.

Quickly try to rescue the crew.

Despite your efforts the majority do not survive. The sole survivor offers to join your crew and helps you strip the now derelict ship of useful components.

(Nano Med-bot Dispersal) Pump their ship with Nano Med-bots to aid in the rescue.

You drag the injured and dying crew on to your ship. The Med-bots help stabilize their condition, but most perish. The surviving shields operator offers to join your crew and helps you strip their broken ship of scrap.

(Teleporter) Lock on to all remaining life signatures and beam them onto your ship.

Your quick reactions allow you to stabilize a few of the seriously wounded crewmembers. An infantryman offers to join your crew and the rest tell you of a hidden Federation base a few jumps from here.

(Heal Bomb) Use a healing bomb to keep them alive.

You launch a healing bomb into their ship and the Nanobots are able to keep the crew stabilized. Once they come to, you send over some supplies to keep them healty enough to get to friendly territory.

Now that they're safe an engineer offers to join your crew and the rest tell you of a hidden Federation base a few jumps from here.

"Thanks, we didn't think there would be Rebel ships all the way out here. They seem to be searching for something. Take some extra supplies as thanks for your aid."

You arrive at the distress beacon near a small asteroid belt and find a ship with pirate markings partially crushed between two large rocks. It must have been illegally mining the belt without proper equipment.

Try to dislodge the ship by shooting at the rocks.

Destroy and loot the ship. They're just pirates.

(Beam Weapon) Carefully cut the ship out.

You use your beam to make a few precision cuts in the asteroid. The ship gives a quick burst of thrust and the rock crumbles away. They thank you and offer some of the resources they have collected.

(Beam Drone) Have your drone cut the ship out.

You program the drone to work carefully around the trapped ship. In a short time it allows the ship to easily slip out of its cage. They thank you and offer some of the resources they have collected.

You take a few careful shots but you expose a mineral patch in the rock that reacts violently with your weapon. A shockwave forces you back as debris pelts against your hull. When you regain control you find there is not much left of the ship.

You fire a few volleys into the rock and it starts to shudder and break apart. Without shields the pirate ship takes a beating but eventually pulls free. They thank you for your assistance.

You decide the pirate is not worth saving and fire a few volleys into their hull causing the ship to depressurize and break apart. You move in to loot the remains.

You decide the pirate is not worth saving and fire a few volleys into their hull. Before you can scrap the remains another pirate ship flashes on your radar. Perhaps they saw your deed, or perhaps they want to claim the spoils for themselves, but for whatever reason, they're charging weapons!

You find a number of ships fleeing from a small space station. You hail them, asking what's wrong: "Help! We're being overrun by some sort of giant alien spiders!"

Send the crew to help! Giant alien spiders are no joke.

Leave them alone.

You can't risk fighting some unknown alien on every backwater station you come across. You prepare to jump.

(Anti-Personnel Drone) Send your battle drone in to help.

You pull up alongside the station and release the drone through the airlock. Within a short time the majority of the creatures are dead, with only a little collateral damage. They express their most sincere gratitude.

(Boarding Drone) Launch a Boarding drone into the station.

You launch the drone and it crashes through their hull, leaving a huge breach. You watch as the drone tears through the creatures while debris and dead bodies fly out of the breach. The owners of the station are less than effusive when they thank you, and offer only a meager payment. Maybe it's a good time to leave...

(Bio Beam) Use the beam to pick off the spiders.

You instruct them to drop their shields and you are able to kill the creatures without damaging the station. "The monsters just started bursting into flame as we watched. What a terrifying weapon... Here, take this for your help, friend."

Your crew boards the station, cautiously moving between corridors. Suddenly a man-sized arachnid bursts from a vent in the ceiling, followed by countless more. You fight your way back to the airlock and are forced to leave before accounting for all crewmembers. Not everybody made it back.

You take a hopeful trip to the Clone Bay, and to your relief a clone is already prepared for the lost crewmember.

Your crew slowly creeps up on a cluster of the creatures from behind. Without warning, the giant arachnids turn and charge. However, your team stays in control and before long you've beaten them back.

Contact the station owners.

They are thrilled with your success and offer you a reward.

The distress signal is coming from a small space station orbiting an uninhabited planet. Their satellite defense system has gone haywire and their repair crew can't approach without being fired on. They're looking for help to fix or disable it.

Promise to help.

You consider your options.

Simply fire on the defense system from a distance.

(Ion Weapon) Disable the defense system.

You use your ion weaponry to disable the gun long enough for their repair crews to fix it. They message you, "I've never seen a weapon like that before! Thanks for your help. Please accept this reward."

(Cloaking) Use your Cloaking to disable the system.

You use your ship's Cloaking to try to prevent the defense system from getting a lock. However before you are able to safely disable the system your cloaking gives out and you are forced to destroy the satellite. No one was harmed but they don't seem happy with your solution.

(Improved Cloaking) Use your Cloaking to disable the system.

You use your ships Cloaking to prevent the defense system from getting a lock. Once closer, you hasten to disable the system without damaging it. It was a sloppy job but they appreciate it and offer a reward.

(Advanced Cloaking) Use your Cloaking to disable the system.

Your ship's Advanced Cloaking allows you to approach the defense system without an issue. Once closer, you are able to safely disable the system. They thank you for your help and offer a reward.

(Engi Crew) Remotely repair its targeting system.

Your crew-member is able to remotely fix the glitch in the defense AI, allowing the repair crew to close in and finish the job. The station gives you its thanks along with a reward.

(Lanius Crew) Your crew offers to help.

Your Lanius crewman appears to have a solution. The Lanius simply jumps out of the airlock towards the satellite. Apparently its lack of heat signatures renders it hidden from the satellite's targeting sensors. Once there he simply melts it down into scrap. You quickly pick him up and prepare to jump before the station can question your methods.

You can't help them so you prepare to move on.

You fire a few volleys from a distance and it is clear the defense system is no match for your weapons. However, the station does not seem happy with your 'solution'. You salvage what you can and jump before there is trouble.

You fire a few volleys but aren't able to penetrate the defense system's shields. Its weapons have no trouble piercing yours though, and you take minor damage before escaping. The station will need to find help elsewhere.

You find the source of the distress call, a small research station. It appears a small laboratory fire got out of control and is threatening to destroy the station. Their fire suppression system is not responding.

Send your crew in a shuttle to help put out the fire.

Dock and try to rescue the survivors.

Leave.

You coldly shut off communications and prepare to leave. Your crew seems upset but you assure them that nothing could have been done.

(Rock Crew) Send your Rock crew-member in.

Your Rock soldier tears through the airlock directly into the fire. You've never seen someone that large move that fast. It disperses as much fire suppressant as possible into the heart of the blaze and eventually the fires start to die down.

Contact the survivors.

With most of the fire under control, the scientists are able to help secure the station. They offer you their sincere gratitude and a generous reward.

(Repair Drone) Send your Repair drone into the fire.

You send the Repair drone in and it methodically puts out the fires. Once it has made some progress, the rest of your crew helps to secure the station.

They offer you their sincere gratitude; the station would have surely been destroyed without your assistance. They transfer a small reward and an additional drone schematic.

You send your crew into the station. Unfortunately as soon as they enter the fire breaches the station's fuel cell containment. You quickly try to dock and retrieve your crew but not before an unfortunate soul is lost in the inferno.

With a new-found respect for flames, your crewmember's clone stumbles out of the Clone Bay.

Your crew valiantly keeps the fire at bay long enough to allow some of the scientists to escape, but it appears to be a losing battle. Before long you order the retreat. The few scientists they were able to save are distraught but grateful. You'll drop them off at the next station.

You locate the highest concentration of life forms and bring the ship alongside the station. Before you can begin to offload the survivors, a huge blast splits the station apart. Your ship is thrown away and some debris pierces your hull. You watch helplessly as the last of the survivors are consumed in the collapse of the station.

You pull up alongside the station and cut through their hull. You are able to rescue a few survivors but many more are lost. One of the survivors offers to join your crew and you offload the rest on a nearby station.

Dr. Jones

You locate a nearby human mining colony where an unknown disease has spread virulently. They are setting up a quarantine to contain it but a riot has broken out.

Send in your crew to help control the crowds.

Ignore their request and move on.

Unfortunately your mission is too important and you're not willing to risk your crew. You prepare to move on.

(Rock Crew) Send your Rock crew-member to prevent a riot.

It's unlikely the Rock's impressive immune system is susceptible to a human virus so you send it in. It is able to intimidate the workers long enough for the colony forces to set up a quarantine. Their leaders offer a reward and assure you they will try to find a cure as soon as possible.

(Engi Crew) Send your Engi to calm down the infected.

With no fear of catching the disease, your Engi crewmember helps reassure and organize the infected humans. Calmed by its extensive knowledge of human physiology, the infected submit to the quarantine in the hopes that a cure can be found soon. The colony leaders offer a reward for helping to prevent an ugly incident.

(Adv. Medbay) Use your Medbay to help synthesize a cure.

Your military-grade medical computers are easily able to isolate the cause of the virus, a previously unknown spore that was unearthed during excavations. You are quickly able to inform the colony's leaders of your success in reverse engineering a cure.

"Thank you so much! We don't have the funds to hire outside help and it would have taken our staff weeks to figure that out. Here, take this as payment!"

(Engi Med-bot Dispersal) Use the Nano med-bots to accelerate the dispersal of the cure.

You reconfigure your ship's Nano dispersal system. In a matter of minutes all of the workers are cured. The leaders can hardly believe what you have achieved. They offer you what they can as payment.

Your crew tries to keep the crowds in line but the scene quickly turns ugly. Half-crazed with fear, the infected grab mining tools and push back at your crew, forcing them to retreat hastily. They barely get away without injury but the same can't be said for the colony's leaders. You quickly leave.

With the visible threat of your weapons, the infected become subdued enough for you to set up a rudimentary quarantine. However before you leave, one of your crew presents signs of infection. You have no choice but to leave them on the station in the hopes that they discover a cure quickly. You leave before more crew succumb.

As your crewman is still alive and working towards a cure, it would be against Federation regulation to create a clone to continue with you on your journey.

What appears to be a civilian ship sends a friendly hail. As you approach the vessel, you detect a teleporter signal but it's too late... intruders have beamed aboard!"

A heavily damaged ship is drifting near this beacon. You receive a communication: "Hello! Nice of you to drop by. As you can see, our ship has seen better days. Yours is looking quite nice, I think we might be taking it from you now." Intruders beam aboard.

You detect life-signs actually on the beacon itself! A teleporter signal warns you but it's too late, they've beamed from the beacon onto your ship and seem intent on taking it over.

Your ship detects a faint distress signal on a nearby moon. As you approach the rock, warning lights flash as hostiles beam aboard the ship from some hidden location.

As you arrive, you become aware of a small Rebel outpost near the beacon. You are hardly able to bark an order before a small team is beamed aboard your ship. They must have been expecting you...

You catch a glimpse of a strange signal coming from a space station before your sensors shut off unexpectedly. As you discover that your sensors are being jammed, you hear hostiles beam onto your ship.

Until you are able to jump away from the hostile space station, your sensors will be disabled. You should deal with these boarders first though!

(Hacking System) Counter the remote hacking.

Your hacking system automatically counters the digital assault. Your Sensors flicker back on and you prepare to fight the boarders.

You arrive to find a small research station putting out a distress signal. There is no response to your hails.

Dock with the station and investigate.

Leave it alone.

(Anti-Personnel Drone) Use an Anti-Personnel Drone to investigate.

(Life Scanner) Run advanced life scans.

Sensors show scattered signs of life although most of the crew are deceased. However the health signatures of the living indicate they are violent and unstable. You decide it's better to move on than risk engaging the remaining crew.

There are no life signs detected on the ship although there appears to be a number of deceased crew. There does not appear to be any airborn contagions so your crew quickly salvages what they can before moving on. You can only wonder what befell the station.

Inside there are signs of a great struggle; scientists lie dead where they fell, brutally dismembered. You grab a few research drone parts lying on a desk near the door and leave quickly.

You dock with the station and see a frantic person banging on the airlock door. Once inside your ship, he drops to the floor saying, "My... friends... They've gone insane... They're coming!" You hand him a blaster and turn to see a number of people charging toward the ship.

Prepare for a fight!

(Medbay) Have the Advanced Medbay analyze their condition.

You hold them off while retreating into the Med-bay. Its advanced systems determine that an alien neurotoxin is the cause of their frenzy. It synthesizes an antidote and releases it into the room. After a time, the scientists recover. One offers their services as thanks for saving them.

As you explore the base, crazed screams are heard. Your team retreats back to your ship with a number of armed scientists in pursuit. One of your team starts to cough and falls in a spasm onto the floor.

Drag him back to the ship and prepare for a fight.

As you get back on board, your injured friend rises up and starts to attack you, screaming. Caught off-guard, your remaining crew fall back as the other scientists fight their way onto the ship.

(Teleporter) Use your Teleporter to retrieve your crew.

You beam your away team back to the ship and disengage from the station. Although the ship is safe, the infected crewmember quickly becomes frenzied and attacks.

(Medbay) Drag him back to the Medbay.

You hold him down and the Medbay is able to stop whatever neurotoxin was on the ship from fully infecting your crew. Once he recovers, you prepare to fight off the scientists, who are beyond help.

(Advanced Medbay) Have the Advanced Medbay analyze their condition.

You hold them off while retreating into the Med-bay. Its advanced systems determine that an alien neurotoxin is driving your crewmember insane. It synthesizes an antidote and releases it into the ship. After a time, the frenzied scientists recover and one offers to help out as thanks for saving them.

You send your Anti-Personnel drone to explore the station. What you find is disconcerting... It appears that something has caused the scientists and guards to tear each other to pieces. You abandon the drone on the station for fear that it is contagious.

Once on board the station, your drone is immediately beset by frenzied scientists and guards. It eventually gets torn apart by the mob but it has bought you enough time to disengage from the station and escape into empty space.

The cameras mounted to your Anti-Personnel drone show a chaotic scene. No people are to be found but the remnants of a recent battle on-board the ship are obvious. You instruct the drone to retrieve some useful materials before leaving.

You jump into the middle of an asteroid field. Looking around, you find you are surrounded by dozens of wrecks of other ships. Faint wisps of light can be seen moving between wrecks. As you watch, they seem to be changing path and floating toward your ship!

(Engines) Activate full impulse drive to escape.

With your Advanced Engines you were able to quickly get out of the asteroid field, however your ship took a number of hits on the way out.

(Piloting) Have your pilot maneuver you out of the asteroid field.

Thanks to your pilot, you were able escape the worst of the asteroid field unscathed. However, the wisps of light stream out of the field following your ship!

You arrive in an asteroid belt to discover that a Rebel automated-scout has been stationed here. Prepare for a fight!

You arrive at the beacon to find yourself dangerously close to a star. An automated Rebel ship, impervious to the heat, moves in to engage.

A ship engineer has set up a small shop here.

You find yourself surrounded by a group of mysterious alien vessels. They hail you and apparently have some valuable technology for sale.

A transmission from the nearby planet indicates an outpost below which offers supplies to travelers. You send down an away party to check it out.

The space station here has a traveling merchant who shows you his wares.

There is only one other ship at this beacon, and it is showing heavy damage. You receive a message on your console: "Greetings traveler. We were crippled by a band of pirates and are now forced to sell our remaining valuable equipment to acquire the necessary supplies to get home."

When you ask a nearby station for aid, a friendly programmer gives you the schematics for a drone!

An abandoned space station circles a lonely planet. A quick check yields schematics for a drone. You bring it aboard the ship.

Federation sympathizers contact you as you arrive. "We know your mission should be secret, so don't ask how we know about it. Take this schematic, it's all we can do to help."

A small Engi research vessel is trying to fend off a Mantis ship. You move in to engage, but after a quick scan of your ship the Mantis ship retreats. The Engi offer you a drone schematic as thanks for your timely arrival.

You find an abandoned mining station on a nearby moon. A quick scan shows no life forms; however, you discover a usable drone schematic!

You receive a wide-band message, "Free schematic samples! Be sure to visit our new military-grade drone store opening in sector XR1-45!"

Holy crap! A weapon is just floating in space!

You inform a nearby station of your flight from the Rebels. They offer to outfit your ship with a weapon and wish you well.

A settlement still loyal to the Federation hails your ship. They have prepared a weapon to aid your escape from the Rebels.

As soon as you arrive a small Mantis ship detaches from a wreck and jumps away. You must have interrupted their salvage operation because you find a weapon ready to be installed!

A small merchant ship messages you, "Underground Federation comm channels are all talking about your 'secret' mission. Let us install a weapon to help. Good luck!"

Debris from a battle is scattered around this system. A few pieces bounce against your ship. You passively scan them and discover there is a functioning weapon among them!

You arrive in a system and immediately discover a pirate ship nearby. Strangely, scans indicate there are no lifeforms aboard. You salvage anything useful, but find no clue as to the whereabouts of the former crew.

Not much remains in this abandoned system; however, scans reveal a nearby mining platform with some salvageable materials.

As you arrive in the system you are hailed by a loyalist settlement. Upon learning of your quest, they offer you supplies.

Debris from a forgotten battle still orbits the gas giant in this system. Some of it still might be usable.

You receive a message from a nearby station, "A Federation cruiser jumping into Rebel territory? Quite the bold move." You quickly move to arm the weapons but he continues, "Lucky for you we're not all in support of the Rebellion. Perhaps these supplies will help you get to friendlier space alive."

You happen upon the remains of a space station. It has been mostly picked clean but there appears to be a few materials that will aid you in your mission.

Accept the offer.

Reject their offer.

A nearby space station hails you. "Greetings! Your arrival is most fortuitous. We recently came across some extra drones. If you have some fuel, perhaps we can make a deal?"

A strange vessel approaches. A digital message appears on your view-screen: "This is an automated merchant. Refill this vessel with fuel and it will supply you with drones."

You arrive in the sector and are greeted by a science vessel waiting by the beacon. They hail you, "We find ourselves low on fuel and have a proposition."

A ship refueling station is stationed at this beacon. We can purchase fuel here.

Buy 6 fuel for 12 scrap.

"Thank you for your business."

Buy 3 fuel for 6 scrap.

Buy 1 fuel for 2 scrap.

Ignore the station.

You see a small station fitted with hundreds of Repair drones. You receive an automated message, "We don't know who you are and we don't care, but this is the right place for some ship repair!"

Repair 20 damage.

"Thank you for your business, no refunds!"

Repair 10 damage.

Repair 5 damage.

There is a black market hub here. You receive a message, "These are dangerous times. If you have extra military-grade explosives, we'll gladly pay you for them."

Sell 5 missiles for 15 scrap.

"Thank you, this will help greatly."

Sell 10 missiles for 30 scrap.

Sell 15 missiles for 45 scrap.

You see a civilian space station with heavy damage. You receive a message, "We've been hit hard by the war. We need more drone parts to speed up our repairs. We'll buy some from you if you have extra."

Sell 3 drone parts for 12 scrap.

Sell 6 drone parts for 24 scrap.

Sell 12 drone parts for 48 scrap.

Trade.

Ignore.

You arrive at a quiet spaceport and are immediately hailed by another ship at port with a "once in a lifetime deal!"

You jump into a sector filled with civilian activity. Your scan the various advertisement channels while waiting for your FTL to charge, and are intrigued by a grey-market shipwright.

Your ship is flooded with advertisement transmissions from nearby merchants as soon as you arrive at this beacon. You arbitrarily pick one to examine in detail.

Despite the barren area, a trader has set up shop at this beacon. He presents his offer.

The beacon at first glance seems home to a junk yard. Upon closer inspection, it reveals itself to be a ramshackle market. One trader has a deal that catches your eye.

A pawn broker has set up shop at this obscure beacon. He might be offering something worth looking at.

This is a great opportunity. Let's dock and see if we can find valuable supplies.

We're in a hurry, let's just quickly pull some scrap off the ship.

Something seems wrong here. Let's just leave.

This beacon lies in an empty section of space. You almost move on before spotting a heavily damaged ship drifting nearby. The ship's markings are unfamiliar.

You share this beacon with just one other ship, but it appears ancient and long since abandoned.

Another ship is jumping away just as you arrive. They send out a quick communication before their jump completes: "That ruined bulk is more trouble than it's worth." You see a drifting, abandoned vessel nearby.

There's a heavily damaged ship at this beacon. You briefly pick up a very distorted communication from the ship but are unable to understand it. Your sensors detect no life-signs.

Your crew complains of hearing strange voices as they work. One requests that they end the salvage operation early.

They're being ridiculous. Finish the job.

They've gathered enough supplies. Let's get going.

(Sensors) Wait, sensors are picking up something strange...

Your sensors are picking up some subtle but anomalous activity, it's as if the ship is slowly activating. You pull everyone back to your ship with what they have gathered.

You recover what you can before making preparations to jump away.

Suddenly the wreckage powers up. Still no life-signs are detected. You have no idea who's piloting the ship, but it has clearly become hostile.

You receive a transmission from the ship: "You got what you came for. Now leave us!" No life-signs are detected still.

You take the empty ship's advice and leave.

This ship could be dangerous to future travelers. We should destroy it.

The salvage operation ends without a hitch. You get your crew-members back on board and prepare to jump away.

Just as they're finishing the salvage operation, your crew reports they're being attacked by what they claim to be the ghosts of the previous crew. They seem confident they can deal with them though.

Order your crew to retreat with what they can and get back to the ship.

Order them to stand their ground, they should be able to handle a few ghosts.

The fight doesn't doesn't go well. Eventually your crew is forced to abandon the supplies and retreat of their own accord.

The ghosts prove to be even weaker than you'd expected. Your crew quickly mops them up and brings back a large cache of supplies.

Your crew is losing the fight against the ghosts. If this continues, you'll lose everyone.

Everyone make a full retreat.

Retreat if possible, but protecting the ship is the primary goal.

You lose a crew-member to the fight but manage to escape the ghost ship and its inhabitants.

You get back to find your crew-member cloned, though annoyed with the command decisions that lead to his death.

The ghosts follow your crew-members back on board the ship!

You arrive at a populated sector. One merchant seems to be mass-broadcasting a request for a mercenary ship to aid him. Shall we respond?

Yes.

No.

"Great, I was worried no one would respond. My usual carrier is days late. I need you to deliver this cargo of drone parts to a small station a few jumps from here. We can't afford to pay another carrier, but they will surely tip you generously."

Accept.

"Great! I uploaded their location to your star map. I'm running out of options, so I have no choice but to trust you'll do what you have agreed to do."

"Fine, I'll keep looking for someone who wishes to make some easy money..."

"Your ship seems reasonably equipped... A freighter carrying a shipment of my goods is a week late. The fools flew through a pirate-filled sector in their haste and I fear for the cargo's safety. I'm looking for a less incompetent captain to investigate."

"At least you're confident, for what little that's worth. Here is their last known location."

"At least YOU are willing to admit your incompetence. Thank you for saving me the cost of paying more fools to go to their death."

You arrive at the location given to you by the merchant. You are supposed to deliver drone parts to a station here.

You find the small research station and discover that it's putting out a distress signal. Strangely, there is no response to your hails.

You find the station and they respond to your hails immediately, saying, "It took you long enough! We have practically no use for these now... I refuse to pay full price, take this and leave the cargo in our holds."

Accept the paltry payment.

You drop the parts off and take your pay.

Refuse and keep the drone parts.

(Mind Control) Convince him that he's being 'unfair'.

"I'm being unfair. You did the job and the parts are here safe and sound. Here is the agreed upon amount."

Accept the new offer.

(Weapons) Remain silent but power up your weapons.

"You make a good point. You traveled all the way out here to fulfill our request, despite what must have been... a difficult scenario to cause such a delay. Here, we'll even tip you for the inconvenience you must have gone through..."

"Fine, I was bluffing. I'll pay the full price."

The merchant disconnects in a huff.

You arrive at the last known location of the merchant's delivery. You begin to scan for the lost ship.

You find the remains of the ship. It seems to have severe external damage, but you cannot pinpoint a cause. The majority of its cargo seems intact. You manage to discern the ship's intended destination.

Take the cargo and head to its original destination in search of a reward.

Take the cargo for yourself.

You find a severely damaged ship floating among some debris. The crew hails you, "I can't believe that cheap bastard sent someone after us! I thought we would freeze to death. If you help us complete the delivery, we'll share the reward and join your crew."

Promise to deliver the cargo and ask if any would be interested in joining your crew.

They upload the delivery destination once on board. One takes you up on your offer, the rest you drop off at a nearby station.

Take the cargo but drop them off at a nearby station.

(Teleporter) Beam the cargo aboard and leave them to their fate.

After a quick scan, you find a ship being chased by a pirate. This must be the missing delivery ship! You move in to rescue them.

The cargo was some food and medical supplies, nothing that you need right now. You make a note of the delivery destination in case you want to drop off the cargo for the payment.

You find a prototype weapon inside. You quickly install it on the ship.

There were general military supplies in the cargo crates. You take what you can use.

You find the station that had ordered your cargo. You drop it off and they respond, "Ignoring the fact that this is days late, we really appreciate that you delivered our materials. We realize how dangerous this sector is these days. Take this as payment."

A Federation encrypted signal is being broadcast from a nearby planet.

Send an away party to investigate.

It could be a trap. Let's move on.

You find a secret Federation outpost. They are regrettably out of supplies but are eager to tell you of another secret base. They give you the coordinates.

You find a hidden Federation outpost. They message you, "Quick, we just got word from a sister outpost that they've been discovered by the Rebels and are under attack! If you are still loyal to the Federation, go save them!"

You find a secret Federation outpost... but it appears the Rebels have found it before you; the place is empty and faint bloodstains can be seen in the living quarters. You find the encrypted signal emitter and shut it off before leaving.

You find a small cache of supplies that were surely left for any loyal Federation ships in trouble. You take all that you need, leaving some for others to find.

As you approach the signal you receive a message on a Rebel channel, "I knew we'd catch some Federation fish with this signal. Prepare to be boarded, scum!"

You find the planet at the indicated coordinates. Your initial scans show the planet to be barren and devoid of life, but you get a prompt reply when you broadcast on Federation frequencies. "Hello! So nice to see friends. We'll bring you up some supplies."

By following the directions given to you, you find a well-disguised outpost. You are welcomed by a friendly face who offers to assist you in your quest by joining your crew.

After a quick search you discover the hidden Federation space-dock. They offer you some supplies in addition to fully repairing your ship.

You search near the coordinates given to you, but your search yields no results. Perhaps they were mistaken.

(Improved Sensors) Run a second scan pass.

Your Advanced Sensors pick faint signatures of what appears to be a storage space hidden under the rock. You find the access point and discover a supply cache whose Federation signal emitter has malfunctioned.

(Advanced Sensors) Run a second scan pass.

Your advanced sensors pick faint signatures of what appears to be a storage space hidden under the rock. You find the access point and discover a weapons cache whose Federation signal emitter has malfunctioned.

(Long-Ranged Scanners) Run a second scan pass.

Your improved scanners pick faint signatures of what appears to be a storage space hidden under the rock. You find the access point and discover a weapons cache whose Federation signal emitter has malfunctioned.

You arrive in the sector to see a small outpost being bombarded by an automated drone. This must be the Federation base you were told about!

"Great. Take this bit of fuel as a down-payment. We'll be one step behind you, following your jump signatures. Don't want to take any risks now, do we?"

"We understand. Not everyone is confident they can survive in these hostile times, let alone take the responsibility of protecting others."

After a short time you receive a message, "Hello. I hope it's not a bother, but I'm looking for an escort to a nearby system. This region is quite dangerous and our ship is not well-armed."

There is a single ship at this beacon. They hail you, "We could really use some help. Our FTL navigation system is shot. Can you help us get to a nearby station where they can patch us up?"

"Hello," your communicator opens a hail from a nearby ship. "Our weapon systems are malfunctioning and we're too afraid of pirates to travel home unassisted. Can you escort us?"

You escort the ship to the requested beacon. Much to your dismay you are ambushed by a Rebel ship. You walked right into their trap!

Shortly after you arrive, the ship you were escorting jumps nearby. They thank you for your help and offer you a reward.

The ship you were escorting thanks you, "I don't think we could have made it without your help. Let my friends patch up some of your hull and show you their wares."

You arrive and the ship you were escorting jumps in behind you. "Thanks for the help. We work at a nearby fusion power plant, we could try to improve your reactor's output as a form of compensation."

Once you arrive at this populated region, you immediately pick up a distress signal. A small shuttle is asking anyone who'll listen for help protecting their family from a Rebel ship. Unsurprisingly, no one has yet responded to their request.

See if you can assist them.

It seems that a small space dock has done something to anger the Rebels. The store there is run by his family and he pleads that you rescue them. He uploads the coordinates of the station to your navigation system.

Ignore their pleas.

You block the channel and prepare to jump as soon as possible.

You follow the directions given to you and find the hidden space dock. The owner hails you, "I got a message that you were coming. I don't normally offer goods to strangers, but I'll make an exception. Take a look."

Once you arrive at the beacon you detect a Rebel scout assaulting a compound on a nearby desolate moon.

Engage the Rebel and rescue the space dock.

Avoid a fight.

After a time the ship powers down its weapons and jumps away. No life-signs are detected on the moon.

You are immediately contacted by a settlement, "Hello, travelers. Your ship seems to be outfitted for combat...care to take up a bit of mercenary work?"

Listen to their offer.

"A space dock is under assault from the Rebels. Although the dock is... technically... illegal within their laws, it's very important for our trade. We'll pay you in fuel and scrap if you promise to save them."

Agree to rescue the store.

They transmit the space dock's coordinates.

They regretfully accept your decision.

"Some of our friends have taken to piracy in the recent chaos of the war. We'd like you to "convince" them of their poor decision by severely damaging their ship. We'll pay you well as long as you don't kill them all."

"Just be sure not to blow them up!" they say nervously as they direct you to a nearby moon. You find the pirate ship docked there. They immediately respond to your appearance with, "Your money or your life!" They must be new to this.

"Fine. I don't know what we'll do about them though..." You prepare to jump away from this sector.

You receive a request, "All of our military ships have been destroyed or damaged during the rebellion. However, there have been reports of a Mantis war camp only a few jumps from us. Can you help?"

Pledge to do what you can.

"Thank you! If you can just give us a count on their numbers perhaps we can get the Rebels to help."

Apologize and decline.

There's no way you are crazy enough to want to take on a Mantis war-band.

You find the Mantis encampment but there are far too many of them to count accurately. You send a long range message back to the settlement with your findings but unfortunately there's not much you can do. It would be suicide to attack directly.

Leave before they notice you.

(Missile Weapon) Bombard their key structures.

You fire at their fuel depot, but a shot from the surface rips the missile to shreds. They must have a planetary defense system set up already! You try to get away but a nearby patrol ship moves in to attack.

(2 Fire Bombs) Teleport fire bombs into key structures.

It appears they have not set up a Teleporter disruption field yet. You deposit one bomb in a fuel depot and another in the barracks. Mantis comm channels fill with panicked chatter and you watch a number of structures go up in flames.

With most of their ships and forces focused on the chaos, you slip undetected to a nearby depot. You find some useful resources and an Engi slave who gladly accepts your liberation.

As you try to leave, a patrol spots you. Wailing sirens begin to blare around the camp and the ship moves in to attack!

They must have been focused on setting up camp since you got far enough away to attempt a jump without being noticed.

With the patrol ship destroyed you hasten to leave. It won't be long before the other ships catch up.

With the patrol ship taken care of you hasten to leave. It won't be long before the other ships catch up.

You arrive to find a number of ships convening around a station. There is some unencrypted chatter between the ships, you tune in and listen for anything interesting.

Overhearing their conversation, it seems that they need to take possession of an enemy ship intact.

Offer your services.

They briefly scan your ship and inform you that you are not "properly equipped" for this type of mission.

If they wanted your help they would surely ask for it. You prepare to leave.

(Teleporter) Offer to board their ship.

(Bio Beam) Offer to 'remove' their crew.

(Fire Bomb) Offer to burn the crew out.

They quickly scan your ship and say, "It appears you could help. A bandit has made off with some very important cargo, though I doubt they have any understanding of what it is they stole. We need you to capture the ship intact.

Agree to capture the ship.

"Great, we'll relay their coordinates. Remember, do NOT destroy that ship! Remember, we'll be right behind you."

"We understand. Hopefully we can find a solution to this on our own." You prepare to jump.

You find the ship that you were asked to capture intact. You're not sure why, but they stressed that it's of great importance that you kill the crew WITHOUT destroying the ship.

The explosion rocks the pirate ship and a brilliant light begins to shine from the wreckage. Before you can react the ship is consumed in a massive chain of explosions that send you careening toward a nearby planet. You struggle to put out the fires and your pilot desperately tries to get the controls online before you're dragged down to the surface. Apparently when they said the ship should not be destroyed they had good reason...

You secure the ship and wait for the merchants to arrive. Upon arrival they message you, saying "Good job. We would prefer if you did not speak of this to anyone."

Accept their offer.

We will not accept surrender!

"Alright, you win! Here's some equipment from our stores, leave us alone!"

The ship repeatedly hails you. It looks like they want to surrender.

"You are considerably more well-armed than I would have thought. We surrender."

They send you a message: "Your ship is surprisingly well equipped! Please take this and let us live."

"Please don't kill us. We will give you everything we have!"

They offer you some of their cargo if you let them live.

They offer to give you some of their goods if you don't destroy their ship.

You get a frantic message, "Take everything we have! Just don't kill us."

"You have clearly bested us. We merely request our lives."

"You have made your point, we are beaten. Take these and leave us to our shame."

"Take everything we have and let's both forget this happened."

They send you a message: "I cannot believe how well equipped your ship is! Please take this and let us live."

"Please don't kill us. We'll give you everything we have!"

"The day is yours! Show us your honor by allowing us to leave with our lives."

The pirates must not have been fully committed to the assault; they have been charging their FTL. They jump away, presumably to repair their ship.

Hail the civilian ship.

The enemy ship appears to be powering up its FTL. It's trying to escape!

There are no more life-signs remaining on the ship. You strip it of useful materials.

With the crew dead, you are able to take the fuel out of storage. You also take all the scrap you can manage.

Now that their ship has been emptied of hostiles, you search it. Eventually you find a prisoner who offers to join your crew.

You find a weapon system on their ship. With no crew to stop you, you can install it on your own.

You find a number of slaves in the cargo hold. They look at you questioningly and one asks if they're to be released. You could use more crew but you don't want to force them all to work for you instead...

Demand the Mantis joins your crew but release the rest.

The Mantis seems fine with the orders, saying "I'm on board if it means we get to kill some Rebels!" You drop the rest off at a nearby station.

Demand the Rockman joins your crew but release the rest.

The Rockman remains silent and you worry there might be trouble. However when you ask him to perform a task he acts without complaint. Perhaps he won't be a problem.

Demand the Engi joins your crew but release the rest.

"Verify primary object is to defeat Rebels, re-establish peace?" You nod and it responds, "Acceptable." You drop the rest off at a nearby station and strip the ship.

It appears the slaves did not survive the fighting. You find their burnt bodies in the hold, but before you strip the ship you hear faint noises in the walls. You break off a latch and a slave falls out of a hidden compartment, coughing. Once recomposed the slave offers to join your crew.

You find two Federation soldiers locked in the cargo hold. The first soldier comes on board asking, "Thanks for the timely rescue. How did command know we were here?"

Well... The thing is...

Before you can get a word in, the second ex-slave burst through the portal asking where they should be stationed. You give them a rundown of your mission and prepare to jump.

Command did not know you were here...

Unfortunately it seems the slaves did not survive the fighting. You strip the ship and prepare to jump.

You scan the ship and detect no life signs. It appears the slaves died in the fight. You strip the ship and prepare to jump.

The ship explodes, leaving behind a substantial collection of useful scrap material.

A ship without life forms within a nearby dense asteroid field is giving off the distress call. Shall we investigate? It could be dangerous.

Search for the ship.

Avoid the area.

Discretion is the better part of valor. Better not risk it.

(Rock Plating) Make a thorough search for the ship without fear of stray asteroids.

You find what appears to be pieces of a derelict ship coated with ice or crystal. Before you have a chance to dock, a few asteroids get past your shields and partially damage your engines. You'll have to pull out!

You find a pirate ship, damaged and abandoned. You salvage what you can and move on.

You find the decaying remains of some kind of ship coated with ice or crystal. You send some crew aboard to explore. Nearly everything is either destroyed or unidentifiable, but one of the weapons appears salvageable and there's a strange stasis pod that catches your eye.

It looks like a massive asteroid is in a direct collision course with the derelict ship! You have to pull your crew out but they want to grab what they can first. What do they take?

Take the weapon and any spare scrap.

Your crew grabs what they can and returns to the ship before the asteroid hits. You take a look at what you've recovered once you move clear of the asteroid field.

Grab the stasis chamber.

Your crew drags the pod back to your ship before the asteroid smashes into the ship, shattering through the crystal coating and destroying the ship.

The pod appears to be functioning but you see nothing but shards of crystal inside. Perhaps someone else will know how to open it.

You arrive at a Zoltan research facility. They say they are researching genetic distortion due to stasis sleep and prolonged FTL travel. They ask if your crew has the time to undergo a few scans.

Participate in their study.

"Alright. Fly safe." You prepare to leave.

(Advanced Medbay) Give them your medical records.

"Thank you! We didn't expect to receive such a significant amount of data regarding your crew's health during FTL travel. Please, accept this for your trouble."

(Damaged Stasis Pod) Ask if they can fix this.

"Interesting. I've never seen a cryogenic system like this. It appears to still be functioning..." They hook it up to their system and run a number of tests on it.

"Amazing! It has the ability to reconstruct the body if it was damaged during transit. Watch." They reactivate the pod and you watch as the hunks of crystal inside reform to build a humanoid structure. The pod slides open and the re-formed alien steps out.

It speaks slowly, "Greetings. I appear to be in your debt. My people isolated themselves a long time ago, but perhaps it's time to re-establish a connection. There's a hidden wormhole near the Rock home-worlds. Perhaps you can take me there so I can properly repay you?"

Ruwen

Your crew calmly lines up for the Zoltans to take their readings. After a short time, the process is done. They contact you, "Thank you for your participation in our study. Please accept these small cakes made from stiff dough as well as some scrap."

As soon as you dock, pirates burst on board and a hostile ship appears on the radar. You hear the Zoltans yell in the distance, "We're being held hostage!"

An ancient device is orbiting within the crystal rings of a nearby gas giant. You can't discern its nature or function, but it seems to have been deactivated for a very long time. Perhaps you can get some scrap from it.

Scrap it.

Better not risk it. The Rock people are unlikely to respond well to vandalism.

(Crystal Crew) Reactivate it.

Your Crystalline companion says, "It looks like we have found the abandoned link to the Crystal home worlds. I can reactivate it." He transmits some codes to the device and it immediately powers on.

Continue.

Before you can react, the space around you distorts and a wormhole forms. You begin to sound the alarm, but your companion calms you and indicates that you should fly directly into the wormhole. You reluctantly do as he says.

You break it apart and take it for scrap. No one will miss it.

As you start to break it apart a Rock military ship jumps nearby, "You think you can come into our sector and just steal whatever you please?! Prepare to die, vandals!"

You arrive near a damaged and dilapidated space station. It appears to be abandoned but you detect faint life signatures on board.

Board the station and look for survivors.

Scrap some of the debris.

While waiting for the FTL drive to charge, you skirt around the edge of the station and collect some scrap.

All around you is the stench of death and decay. The life sign readings must have been malfunctioning because you really doubt anything could be alive in here. You quickly return to the ship.

Human corpses are scattered across the station. You find the source of the signal, a lone survivor that locked themselves in a storage closet. You quickly retreat with them in tow back to the ship, and hope they can recover enough to be of some use.

All around you is the stench of death and decay. Suddenly, one of your crew bends over and starts retching violently. Some sort of disease must have wiped out this station. You pull back to the ship, but it looks like your crewmember is not going to make it.

Your crewmember insists you leave them behind, not wanting to endanger the rest of the crew. Knowing the truth of this, you hurry back to the ship.

You stop your crew's clone from forming, knowing that the disease would follow into his next life.

(Improved Medbay) Try to cure the disease.

Your advanced medical suite is able to isolate the cause of the problem and administer an antidote. That was a close one.

Scanners are showing intelligent life forms on a nearby planet. No match for them can be found in the database.

Investigate.

You land a small shuttle in an enormous field, whose only occupants are small, brightly colored, six-legged, horse-like animals. Could they be what your scans picked up?

Try to communicate peacefully.

Bring some of the creatures on board to sell.

This isn't the time for exobiology. You head back to the ship.

(Slugman Crew) Attempt to communicate telepathically.

After a moment, your crew tells you that these are simple beings, who enjoy a peaceful life. However, this isn't the first time a ship has landed here. They inform you of a nearby crash site.

You follow their directions and discover an ancient Engi ship. You find a deactivated Engi inside and reroute power from your shuttle to resuscitate it. After a while it reboots, rebuilds itself, and offers to join your crew.

Ignore it.

You ignore the readings and prepare to move on.

None of your attempts to communicate seem to work: they just stare at you silently. As you prepare to leave, one of the creatures canters forward and forcefully nudges you away from the ship. He seems to want you to follow him. Eventually, they guide you to an old Engi ship's crash site. Inside you are able to find and reactivate an Engi!

You try to communicate in every possible way you can but they just stand there, silently judging you with their large, expressionless eyes. You prepare to leave.

The seemingly docile creatures quickly turn violent when you reveal your hostile intentions. Their well-organized stampede forces you to draw weapons and make a rushed and shambolic retreat to the shuttle.

The seemingly docile creatures quickly turn violent when you show your hostile intentions. They stampede with terrifying force, trampling one of your crew before you have time to react. You fight your way back to the shuttle and prepare to jump.

The trampled crewmate's clone is already ready when you get back to your ship.

As you jump in, you immediately see an impressive Slug pirate ship with "The Black Raven" painted on one side. They hail you, "Greetingsss. I am the dreaded pirate, Captain Nights. You mussst be full of fear, no? You have heard of me... no?"

"Well I have heard of you and I must see if you are as dangerousss as they say. I challenge you!"

Accept his challenge.

"I sssee... However you have no choice in the matter!" They move in to attack.

(Slugman Crew) Engage in a duel of the mind.

Your Slug crewman's eyes glaze over as the two telepaths concentrate. You can only wonder what is happening. After a short time your comrade grunts in pain and collapses onto the floor, stunned. Nights responds, "Hah! It'll take more than that to defeat me! Let the real battle begin!"

Your Slug crewman's eyes glaze over as the two telepaths concentrate. You are powerless to help, but after a short time your comrade shakes off the daze and appears victorious.

His face contorted with pain, Nights concedes his defeat: "If this is the caliber of subordinatesss you keep, there iss no way we can defeat you. Take thisss and let us leave in shame."

"I see the rumorsss are true. I yield, we are no match for you. Take this and let us leave in ssshame."

Accept his surrender.

He transfers over the goods and starts to repair his ship.

Ignore him and attack.

"Wait! There is no need to be...." You cut off the transmission and prepare to fire.

"The Black Raven" breaks apart and you salvage the remains.

The once-dreaded pirate Nights has been killed and you proceed to loot his ship.

You are immediately hailed by an impressive looking Mantis ship, "Your ship would make a mighty fine prize. Prepare for battle!"

You pick up more chatter from the enemy ship, "You know what... Forget this. Prepare for retreat!" Looks like they're preparing to make a hasty get away!

The ship made an emergency FTL jump, but it looks like they didn't mask their signatures. You could easily follow them if you want.

After them!

You input their coordinates into your map and prepare to follow.

Forget it.

They're not worth the trouble. You prepare to leave.

Their ship breaks apart and you move in to scrap the remains.

With no more crew on board you are free to salvage what you can from the remains.

You catch up with the Mantis ship that escaped before, only to see them transferring their crew into an even bigger ship!

"Not YOU again! Do you know how much these repairs are going to cost me? Time to take out the big guns."

They appear to be trying to get away again. You doubt they'll forget to mask their jump signature this time.

Looks like they got away. At least you're able to scrap their abandoned fighter.

"Look, you proved your point. We don't want to die... Take this and let us go. Please?"

Let them live.

"Thank you. But do you have any idea how much repairing TWO ships will set us back?..." What an odd Mantis. You prepare to leave.

Finish them off.

"No! Hurry up, get us out of here! They're crazy!" You cut transmissions.

Their ship breaks apart and you salvage the two ships.

You find an intact weapon on their now empty ship. You take as much scrap from the ships as possible.

You arrive just in time to see an unusually well-armed Engi ship destroying a small pirate craft. A teleporter signal is detected...intruder on deck!

A young Mantis in a charred uniform has teleported onto the deck. He begs for sanctuary from the Engi, and offers to serve in exchange for your protection. The Engi have already traced the teleporter signal and are offering a deal in exchange for the prisoner.

Side with the fugitive and fight the Engi ship.

Agree to offer up the Mantis in exchange for a bounty.

It was a trap! The Mantis sabotages your ship before teleporting away.

He expresses his thanks and prepares to help you fight his pursuer.

The Engi captain is delighted, and quickly arranges for the transfer of the prisoner.

Fury sparks in the eyes of the Mantis. He won't go easily, and causes serious damage before he can be captured.

The pursuing ship responds with a completely unintelligible message. The young Mantis jerks to attention and assumes a battle stance. It was a trap!

A Rebel ship is patrolling this beacon, and immediately turns to engage. As your crew scramble to battle readiness, sensors detect a short-range teleporter signal. An intruder is on board!

A flushed and panicky rebel soldier has teleported aboard. The rebel, who appears unarmed, repeatedly declares his peaceful intentions. It seems the rebel life has lost its charm.

Accept his proposal, and prepare to fight the Rebel ship.

Reject his offer. You can never trust these Rebels.

Your fearless crew easily overcome the intruder, but the Rebel ship still needs to be dealt with.

Attempting to deal with attacks from inside and out is never easy!

He offers to lead you to a secret cache of scrap nearby if you let him join your crew.

Reluctantly accept his proposal and fight the Rebel ship.

Reject him outright and execute him on the spot.

Reject his offer again.

The dishonorable Rebel has deceived you. He damages your engines and steals your flight data before teleporting away. The fleet will be able to track you with ease. If they can't kill you now that is!

Your new crew-member smiles, then reveals a small remote trigger in the palm of his hand. Explosions rocket around the ship as more intruders teleport aboard!

Relieved and light-headed, your new crewmember gets to work as the Rebel ship attacks.

The Rebel makes to take his assigned station, then suddenly turns and eviscerates the nearest crew-member. Red Alert!

The eviscerated crewmember's clone launches out of the clone bay, eager to seek revenge.

The dishonorable Rebel has deceived you. He damages your ship and steals ship information before teleporting away. The fleet will be able to track you with ease. If they can't kill you now, that is!

Arriving at the specified coordinates you find a sizable stash of useful materials.

You arrive at the location of the hoard, but discover that it was not quite as large as advertised.
